 It is important to know where ancient theater is being produced, but it is equally important for those who produce it be exposed to one another's ideas. By focusing individual issues on different themes, we hope to be able to cover a wide range of important topics from several points of view. While reviews and listings will remain a constant of <i>Didaskalia</i>, the nature of features will vary from issue to issue.<br>
 <br>
 Issue 1 is devoted to the theme 'Education and Outreach', and provides examples of different means of bringing ancient theater to a wider audience and the importance of experience with the genre to those involved. Issue 2 will concern itself with moving 'Beyond Spoken Drama' and into not only the music and dance of tragedy and comedy but also other areas of performance such as pantomime and operatic adaptations. Issue 3 will look at the challenges of 'Translating for the Stage', and Issue 4 at fusions of Greek and Asian performance. Issue 5, 'Embodying Ancient Theater', will examine the logistics of producting Greek and Roman theater from acting to set design.<br>
 <br>
 We are all here to increase our acquaintance with ancient theater and its current practitioners. To that end, the editors welcome responses to what we publish. <i>Didaskalia</i> should be a medium for the fruitful--and indeed spirited--exchange of ideas. And we wish that exchange to take place among as large and diverse a population as possible.<br>
 <br>
 I would like to thank Yopie Prins, who nominated me for this position, and Ian Worthington and Peter Toohey, without whom <i>Didaskalia</i> in its present form would have been impossible. <br>
