  <p>Sophocles' <i>Oedipus Tyrannos</i><br>
 <br>
 Theatre Company: Theater and der Ruhr (Germany)<br>
 Director: Roberto Ciulli<br>
 <br>
 Date: March 16 only.<br>
 <br>
 Venue: Rotterdam, Rotterdamse Schouwburg<br>
 Phone: 31 10 4044111<br>
 <br>
 Approach (taken from the season's program of the Rotterdam Schouwburg): 'Director Ciulli does not concentrate on the power of fate or the incest myth, but on man in search for truth and self- knowledge. Oedipus, laughable, directs his own comedy here. At the end he covers himself with his coat, takes Iokaste's hairpins to cut out his eyes and screams terribly. The chorus of Thebans are glad: the pest will leave the city at last. But, it's just a game: Oedipus stands up unharmed. A death crook will afterwards be the blinding instrument: Oedipus looses the battle against fate.'<br>
 <br>
