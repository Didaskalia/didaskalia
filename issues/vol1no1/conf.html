  <h2>LISTINGS: CONFERENCES AND RESOURCES</h2>
  <p>INTERNATIONAL SOCIETY FOR THE STUDY OF GREEK AND ROMAN MUSIC<br>
 <br>
 The purpose of this new organization is to encourage research and teaching concerned with the music of the Greek and Roman civilizations, and to foster contacts between scholars working in this field. The Society's conception of its subject is open-ended, extending beyond the minutiae of musical practice and theory themselves to the study, for instance, of relations between music and other aspects of life and the arts in antiquity, of the roles of ideas derived from music in philosophy and science, and of the relations between the music of Greece and Rome and that of other cultures, including those of medieval and renaissance Europe.<br>
 <br>
 The Society's first task will be to collect information about current research projects, new publications and related activities. Details of these will be published in a regular Newsletter which will be circulated to members. We hope that in due course the Society will also be able to take an active role in publishing of a more orthodox sort, and in arranging conferences.<br>

 NEW WORK ON COMPARATIVE TRAGEDY<br>
 <br>
 <i>Dying Acts: Death in Ancient Greek and Modern Irish Tragic Drama</i> by Fiona Macintosh<br>
 (Cork University Press, September 1994)<br>
 <br>
 As death has receded from the public domain in many modern Western societies, its presence has loomed increasingly large in much academic discourse. However, its representation in drama, and in the tragic drama in particular, has been all but neglected. Indeed, it is the death <i>of</i> tragedy rather than death <i>in</i> tragedy that has provided the focus of academic discussion. But it is only by considering both ancient and modern attitudes to death, together with these stage representations, that the absence of tragedy from much serious modern drama can be explained.<br>
 <br>
 This book explores the relationships between the dramatic representations of death in two societies where elaborate rituals make death and dying a part of the processes of living in a way that is now alien to most modern Western societies. But it is not simply the shared conception of death that makes a comparison between the Greek tragedies and the Irish plays written some two and a half thousand years later both a valuable and an instructive task. The fact that mythical material forms the basis for many Irish plays written during the Literary Revival also makes such a comparison useful. Moreover, the writers of the Irish tragedies discussed-- notably Yeats and Synge--explicitly explicitly turned to the Greek tragedians as <i>exempla</i> in their attempt to found a national theatre. And the Irish hero Cuchulain was regularly compared to the Greek heroes Heracles and Achilles by Celtic scholars, no less than by the playwrights themselves.<br>
 <br>
 This wide-ranging study will be of interest to students of Cultural Studies and Comparative Literature as well as those following courses in Irish Studies, the Classics, and Drama. By its comparative method, it sheds new light on both dramatic traditions and answers important questions concerning the complex interrelations of text and audience.<br>
