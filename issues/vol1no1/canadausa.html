 <i>The Maenads</i> by Bill Roxborough<br>
 Vancouver Fringe Festival, 1994<br>
 <br>
 A production of a new work based on the myth of the rending of Orpheus is being prepared. The writer will be using many of the same performers as he has used in his earlier pieces, The Bronte91 Brothers and A Grimm Tale.<br>

 The play will explore gender conflict in contemporary society. It will be presented at the Vancouver Fringe Festival in September, 1994, perhaps as a work-in-progress.<br>

 Atellan Farce<br>
