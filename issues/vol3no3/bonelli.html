 <p>The book, which belongs to the collection of the 'Giunti Classics,'
  under the scientific revision of E.V. Maltese, includes an extensive Introduction, the
  text with Italian translation and footnotes, and a detailed bibliography. The text is that
  of G. Murray; the editor points out (p. 136) that she had no access to Diggle's new Oxford
  Euripides (1994) until her proofs were on the way to the printer. She moves away from
  Murray's text in some passages listed in a 'Note on the text and translation' (pp. 135-6,
  where she also focuses on the MS tradition) and accurately discussed in the footnotes.</p>
 <p>The introduction is entitled 'From myth to drama: the ambiguous gift of
  beauty,' hinting that the heroine's misfortunes arise not only from her beauty, but also
  from the relationship of doubleness and ambivalence between Helen and her <i>eidolon</i>.
  Barone first examines the development of the mythical Helen, from Homer to Euripides'
  Trojan Women and Gorgias' <em>Encomion</em> in order to highlight the completely
  different way Euripides handles her character in <em>Helen</em>. In the latter we have
  the 'new' Helen of Aristophanes <em>Thesmophoriazusai</em> (850) who is no longer a
  licentious, forward woman, but a faithful wife unfairly slandered.</p>
 <p>Barone builds up the dramaturgical development effectively, underlining
  its basic features, among which the theme of the double Helen stands out. The appearance
  of Helen's <i>eidolon</i> in Troy causes the real Helen to suffer 'loss of identity'--a
  fate which is for modern spectators 'the most truly dramatic core in the first part of the
  work' (XVI). Barone likens Helen's appeal to that of some of Pirandello's characters,
  'Forced to play a part which has no correspondence to their inner selves, behaving as
  claustrophobic prisoners tied to the roles imposed on them from the outside' (ibid.).
  After learning of Leda's suicide, Menelaus' supposed death, and the disappearance of the
  Dioscuri, Helen actually feels responsible even though she cannot be blamed for the
  reported events. The blame is laid on her double, which people take for her to such an
  extent that she ends up by identifying herself with it rather than the other way round.</p>
 <p>Behind the <i>eidolon</i> are the gods whose victim Helen is. The
  coercive role they play in the tragedy has its modern counterpart in bourgeois drama: the
  'others,' the society which forces us to behave according to its unbreakable patterns and
  rules. The <i>eidolon</i> also reveals the gods' negative attitude towards human beings,
  their utter indifference to our sufferings, because it was the gods' will that so much
  blood be shed over a phantom . This is why 'the sorrowful, desperate words of the old
  soldier echo loudly, when he incredulously remarks that men fought for a cloud,' (XXIII).
  Despite the overturning of Helen's reputation, this play too deals with the inhumanity of
  war, just as <em>Trojan Women</em> did. Barone recognizes a consistency between the
  two plays in Euripides' portrayal of the human condition as unsafe and precarious.</p>
 <p>She also underlines another aspect of 'novelty' in <em>Helen</em>,
  an 'experimentation' typical of late Euripides and shared with such works as <em>Ion</em>, <em>Orestes</em>, and the two Iphigeneia plays. This novelty expresses itself in the
  fictional plot with its <i>coups de th&eacute;&acirc;tre</i>, in the fact that the tragedy develops
  through the unforeseen and thus anticipates features of New Comedy and the late
  Hellenistic novel (XXI). Barone pays particular attention to the effect of this kind of
  plot on performance.</p>
 <p>The Italian translation is both modern and fluent, neither overly
  literal nor 'classicizing', thus making it suitable for both reading and performance. The
  translation never falls into gratuitous modernizing in its pursuit of fluency. The
  footnotes, besides providing necessary explanations for non- specialist readers, allow a
  close examination of the topic both from a philological-literary point of view and from a
  theatrical one. They refer to the full range of literature on the subject, with which the
  editor establishes an exhaustive, convincing comparison. This secondary literature is
  gathered in a heavily annotated bibliography in which works are assessed in light of the
  most recent scholarship. This bibliography, along with Barone's subtle analysis, make the
  book relevant to serious scholars of Euripides as well as to those encountering the play
  for the first time.</p>
