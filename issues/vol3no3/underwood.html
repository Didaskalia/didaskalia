 <p>According to its publicity literature <a
  HREF="http://www.pullins.com/txt/classtrn.htm">(http://www.pullins.com/txt/classtrn.htm)</a>,
  the US-based Focus Classical Library comprises 'texts for the educational market,
  primarily at college level'. But the educational market is a large and diverse sector; and
  the texts themselves contain no explicit statement of aims and strategies. So can we be
  more specific about their potential users?</p>
 <p>There are, it seems to me, two categories of college student to whom
  they are going to be especially useful. The first is the student reading the plays in the
  original Greek. These translations are first and foremost old-fashioned cribs, direct
  descendants of Brodie and Loeb. They follow the Greek text line for line, almost word for
  word. Heroic attempts are made to reflect the nuances of particles. The only departures
  are minor adjustments to rectify, for very understandable reasons, inversions and other
  irregularities in the word order, most notably in the choral songs. This translation
  strategy adheres to the idea of faithfulness expressed by Nabokov:</p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>The person who desires to turn a literary masterpiece into another
   language, has only one duty to perform, and this is to reproduce with absolute exactitude
   the whole text, and nothing but the text. ... If such accuracy sometimes results in the
   strange allegoric scene suggested by the phrase 'the letter has killed the spirit', only
   one reason can be imagined: there must have been something wrong with the original letter
   or with the original spirit, and this is not the translator's concern. (1)</p>
 </blockquote>
 <p>The second is the student studying the plays in a course on classical
  civilisation. The translations themselves are accompanied by extensive notes (2) on
  matters of fact, notably mythology and geography (though there is little about the
  symbolic geography which is an important aspect of both these plays). Moreover, the
  translations and their notes are in turn surrounded by an extensive critical apparatus.
  Halleran's <em>Heracles</em> has a fourteen- page Introduction before the translation,
  in which he covers Euripides, the <em>Heracles</em> in performance, and the myth, as
  well as a fifteen-page 'Interpretation' and list of suggestions for further reading after
  it. Podlecki's <em>Medea</em> has an eleven-page Introduction, covering the mythical
  background, Medea in the work of Euripides and the design of the ancient Greek theatre,
  and eight pages of appendices, three of which are translations of ancient plot summaries
  and five of which list suggestions for further reading. Halleran, as one would expect of
  the author of <em>Stagecraft in Euripides</em>, has plenty of stimulating material on
  how <em>Heracles</em> would have been performed and how it might have been received by
  its Athenian audience. </p>
 <p>Podlecki is less interested in this, although he does have a (short)
  account of <em>Medea</em>'s subsequent cultural history. His focus is more on
  characterisation and through it on moral interpretations of <em>Medea</em>. An
  interesting feature of his volume is that its bibliography does not merely list the works
  of interest but also includes one or two sentences from them, partly as a summary of their
  main argument and partly in relation to his own argument. Much of this critical apparatus
  might usefully form the basis of discussion and debate at student seminars.</p>
 <p>Equally, there are two categories of college student to whom these
  translations are not going to be helpful. The first is the college drama group wanting to
  perform the plays. In an article 'Translating for Actors' (3) Robert Corrigan names
  'speakability' as his first law in translating for the theatre: 'It is necessary at all
  times for the translator to hear the actor speaking in his mind's ear'. He also touches on
  the problems of translating culture-specific references for performance: a point picked up
  in an essay by Peter Arnott, 'Greek Drama and the Modern Stage' which gives the translator
  the licence to edit or expunge (among several other awkward inconveniences) allusions
  which will not be intelligible to a theatre audience --the specific example he gives is
  the Ino chorus in <em>Medea</em>. Now imagine sitting in a theatre seat with the house
  lights dimmed for the opening lines of Halleran's <em>Heracles</em>:</p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>What mortal does not know of the man who shared his marriage bed with
   Zeus,<br>
   Amphitryon of Argos, whom Alcaeus, Perseus' son,<br>
   Once begot, me, the father of Heracles ? (4)</p>
 </blockquote>
 <p>Anyone acting this would have no chance of speaking it clearly; and
  anyone listening to it would be forgiven for wondering whether the 'me' refers to
  Amphitryon, Alcaeus or Perseus. Another example from later in the same play, in an
  exchange between Amphitryon and Heracles:</p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>A And is the beast really in Eurystheus' house ?<br>
   H The grove of the Chthonian and the city of Hermione have it. (ll.614-5) (5)</p>
 </blockquote>
 <p>Again, the audience would be none the wiser. The translator has resisted
  writing into the text the one two-letter or three-letter word which would help them. The
  strategy of these translations places faithfulness above performability.</p>
 <p>The second--and this is by far the most important category of the
  four--is the student wanting to increase his/her literary awareness and appreciation by
  enjoying these plays in their own right. In his introduction Halleran refers in passing to
  Euripides' 'words' as 'vivid, moving and finely- textured poetry': but, sadly, poetry is
  what gets left behind when the introduction ends and the translation starts.</p>
 <p>The English language has many technical resources available to the
  writer or translator who wants to heighten language in the direction of poetry. If we
  think of translations of Homer, for example, Lattimore and Logue use two completely
  different repertoires to achieve end results which are undoubtedly poetic if in very
  different ways. In their adaptations of the tragedies, Tom Paulin and Seamus Heaney
  approach the act of translation from a similar starting-point: yet the results they
  achieve are different to the point where the only similarity between them is their
  assertion of the poetic in their originals. Halleran and Podlecki, however, almost
  ostentatiously spurn all the available lexical resources. Also, they choose not to exploit
  any of the effects which might be achieved by using, or even hinting at, rhyme, metre or
  rhythm.</p>
 <p>Instead, what we get in both these translations is a curious mixture of
  the cod and the colloquial. By 'the cod' I mean lines and passages which would have a home
  in the famous Housman parody of a Greek tragedy. Here are some examples from <em>Heracles</em>:</p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>Don't the good among mortals have the resources<br>
   For arguments, even if they're sluggish at speaking? (236-7)</p>
  <p>Children, we are being led off, a not pretty yoke of corpses. (454)</p>
  <p>Apollo, with what an opening do you begin your speech. (538)</p>
  <p>Why won't you cry out a silent<br>
   Lamentation, old man ? (1053-4)</p>
  <p>I know nothing except one thing: everything of yours is in misfortune.
   (1143)</p>
 </blockquote>
 <p>and from <em>Medea</em>:</p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>You! The scowling hater of your husband. (271)</p>
  <p>O dearest hands, lips dearest to me<br>
   And form and face of my children so well born<br>
   Be fortunate. (1071-3)</p>
 </blockquote>
 <p>and finally an all-purpose summary of Greek drama:</p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>Realise finally that your children are no more. (1311)</p>
 </blockquote>
 <p>This would all be admirably Nabokovian were it not for other moments
  when the translations go to an opposite extreme, in the form of extensive use of
  colloquialism. This is more evident in <em>Medea</em> than in <em>Heracles</em>:
  Podlecki offers us among many others 'I'm the one who gives the orders here', '... a fine
  blot on the new bridegroom's record', 'Jason, you've packaged these arguments
  attractively', 'my husband is the worst man in the world', '... a millstone round my
  enemies' necks', 'it's natural that you should put up with my moods', 'I thought this over
  and saw how very stupid I'd been' and (Jason to his children) 'I want to see you grow up
  big and strong' (274-5, 513-4, 576, 690, 808-9, 870- 1, 882-3, and 920 respectively). But
  Halleran also has his moments, notably when Heracles anticipates the reaction of the
  Athenian citizenry to his arrival in their city: </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>'Isn't this Zeus' son, who at one time killed his children<br>
   And wife ? Let him get the hell out of this land.' (1289-90)</p>
 </blockquote>
 <p>to which one can hear the voice of Heracles as played by John Wayne
  saying 'The hell I will'.</p>
 <p>There are also some notable moments when cod and colloquial come
  together: for example, Halleran's Heracles to his children after they have apparently been
  saved and are about to go back into the palace where they will in fact shortly be killed
  by their father:</p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>'So your entrances to it are fairer <br>
   Than your exits from it, right ?' (623-4).</p>
 </blockquote>
 <p>or this cumulative exchange between Podlecki's Medea and Jason about
  their children who will in fact shortly be killed by their mother:</p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>J. And you, why do you turn your fair cheek<br>
   Away? Why shed such abundant tears?<br>
   Were you not pleased to hear what I just said?<br>
   M. It's nothing. I was thinking about these children.<br>
   J. Cheer up, then, for I'll take good care of them.<br>
   M. Very well, then, I don't distrust your words;<br>
   But a woman is womanish and prone to tears.<br>
   J. I don't understand why you're weeping so much for these children.<br>
   M. I bore them! (ll.922-930)</p>
 </blockquote>
 <p>The voice one can hear in response to the last line of this passage is
  Dylan Thomas: 'Someone round here is boring me, and I think it's me'.</p>
 <p>'Lament what is truly lamentable', Halleran's messenger declares when he
  comes to tell of Heracles' madness and its consequences. Should we also lament these truly
  lamentable translations, or excuse them on the grounds that they are intended 'for the
  educational market, primarily at college level'?</p>
 <p>My own view is that we should lament. It is not axiomatic that cribs
  must be unreadable. Some Loebs are more readable than others. For that matter, I find
  Podlecki more readable than Halleran, although, perhaps because he is trying harder to be
  readable, his lapses into bathos are more profound. The overall failure of these
  translations is also profound, for there is nothing in them to suggest why any of the four
  categories of student mentioned above should read these works at all. For all the
  worthiness of the surrounding critical apparatus, the translations belittle Euripides and
  the potential of his plays for student users. Possibly they belittle their student users
  as well: what is 'for the educational market' is not necessarily truly educational.</p>

  Review</em> 1955, vol. 4, p. 504 and 510.</p>
 <p>(2) Nabokov from the same article: 'I want translations with copious
  footnotes, footnotes reaching up like skyscrapers to the top of this or that page so as to
  leave only the gleam of one textual line between commentary and eternity' (p.512)</p>
 <p>(3) Robert W.Corrigan, 'Translating for Actors' and Peter Arnott 'Greek
  Drama and the Modern Stage' are both in William Arrowsmith and Roger Shattuck eds., <em>The
   Craft and Context of Translation</em>, University of Texas Press, 1961. The notion of
  performability which is implicit in their articles is firmly rejected by Susan
  Bassnett-McGuire in her essay 'Ways through the Labyrinth: Strategies and Methods for
  Translating Theatre Texts' , in Theo Hermans ed., <em>The Manipulation of Literature:
   Studies in Literary Translation</em>, Croom Helm 1985, pp.87-102: 'what it
  (performability) seems to imply is an attempt in the target language to create fluent
  speech rhythms and so produce a text that TL speakers can speak without too much
  difficulty (at least in the opinion of the translator).' Instead, she offers a complex
  account, located in contemporary semiotic theory of both translation and theatrical
  performance, of the range of strategies open to the translator working with a dramatic
  text.</p>
 <p>(4) Vellacott's Penguin, itself rather flat-footed, is at least clearer:
  'Is there a man living who has not heard of me /Amphitryon of Argos, whose bed welcomed
  Zeus?/Son of Alcaeus, grandson of Perseus; and father/Of Heracles.'</p>
 <p>(5) Vellacott again is clearer: ''Who keeps him now? Eurystheus?' 'No;
  He's at Hermione, in Demeter's sacred grove.''</p>
