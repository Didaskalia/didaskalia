<h1 id="journal_title">The Performance of Homeric Epic</h1>
<p class="journal_abstract"><a href="editorial.html">This issue is long overdue. Though it might be winter for readers in the Southern Hemisphere, it is certainly not 1996. The contents of the issue nevertheless pertain to events in the winter of 1996. In particular, our Features section is made up of papers delivered at the American Philological Association's annual meeting in New York. The panel was sponsored by the APA Committee for the Performance of Classical Texts, whose survey of drama in the classroom can be accessed from Didaskalia's home page. Our next issue (Didaskalia 4.1) will include he papers from another APA panel, 'Crossing the Stages,' and we also hope to publish the papers from the Seneca panel in due time. We are also collecting material for a Supplement consisting of performance scripts. Submissions are welcome. So are volunteers to help with HTML markup. [ Read more ]...</a></p>
