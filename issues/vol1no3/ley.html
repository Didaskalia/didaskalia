 <br>
 Modern productions of Greek tragedy--and indeed the entire modern concept of tragedy--got off to a bad start. Among the writings of the Florentine Camerata, whose members attempted to revive Greek tragedy and hence created opera, is an essay entitled 'Discourse on how Tragedy should be Performed.' It begins by enjoining would-be producers of tragedy to reflect on the techniques of the ancients, and offers such prescriptions as, 
  <blockquote> <p> 'When you want to perform a tragedy, the theater  ought to be more magnificent and ornate than that for a comedy...adorned  with lovely architecture, full of statues. The stage should be rich  and well- designed, fitted with splending, beautiful, hanging lamps.'  (1)</p>
  </blockquote>
  The author is already violating his own injunction to pay 
  attention to practices of antiquity, ignorant of or ignoring the fact 
  that the Greeks themselves were quite happy to produce comedy and tragedy 
  in the same acting area.<br>
  <br>
  Centuries after the Renaissance, the distorted views of the Florentines, 
  which relied all too heavily on Aristotle and Pollux, had become firmly 
  entrenched. When Howard Paul and George Gebbie published <i>The Stage 
  and its Stars, Past and Present</i> in 1890, they quoted at length a description 
  of Athenian performance in which Pollux seems to have eclipsed Aristotle 
  entirely and there is no sign of the fifth century beyond a brief listing 
  of tragedians' names:<br>
  <br>
   
  <blockquote> <p>'To increase their height the tragic performers wore  the <i>cothurnus</i>, a sort of buskin with high soles and still higher  heels, which compelled them tow alk with a measured and sounding tread;  and a top-knot of hair or toupee (<i>ongkos</i>) suitable to the age  and condition of the character represented. A corresponding breadth  of figure was produced by means of padding. Thus equipped, the tragic  hero seemed a giant as compared with ordinary mortals.' (2)</p>
  </blockquote>
   Serious students of ancient stagecraft have all long-since 
  brushed aside such misconceptions like cobwebs. But the image conjured 
  by our scholarly predecessors continues to haunt us. Visions of hordes 
  of extras, larger- than-life characters, stilted acting, and obscure ritual 
  significance terrify many university theater departments, and many young 
  actors, into believing that Greek tragedy is far beyond their own resources. 
  And textbooks on theater history and even theater architecture provide 
  so compressed a version of the development of Greek drama that the resulting 
  picture of ancient theater is not much more enlightening than that presented 
  by the Florentine Camerata. Many courses on Greek literature in translation 
  ignore the performance aspect of Greek drama altogether.<br>
  <br>
  But accurate information about the performance of fifth-century tragedy 
  and comedy is making its way into forms less daunting than Pickard- Cambridge's 
  <i>Dramatic Festivals of Athens</i>. Iris Brooke's 1962 <i>Costume in 
  Greek Classic Drama</i> and Oliver Taplin's 1978 <i>Greek Tragedy in Action</i> 
  are still extremely useful books. But new interpretations of the small 
  and sometimes dubious body of evidence about Athenian theatrical practice 
  are proliferating at a rapidly-expanding pace. In order to keep future 
  generations from having to unlearn centuries of obsolete misconceptions, 
  we need new introductory works which incorporate cutting-edge scholarship 
  and can help lay better foundations for future work in the fertile zone 
  where classics and theater overlap.<br>
  <br>
  Graham Ley's <i>A Short Introduction to the Ancient Greek Theater</i> 
  is an admirable example of such a work. Beginning from the premise that 
  'for the reader of what was originally a performed work, some attempt 
  should be made to indicate te original performance conditions' (p. 1), 
  Ley provides a discussion of Greek theater in the fifth century which 
  is not only impressively comprehensive but eminently comprehensible. Clear 
  language and clear diagrams guide the reader through the structural and 
  functional similarities of the Pnyx and the Theater of Dionysus, the organization 
  and funding of the dramatic festivals, the basics of costumes and masks, 
  the prevalence of animal costumes in comic choruses, and so forth. Ley 
  acknowledges the many uncertainties and controversies about such things 
  as the shape of the TDA without entangling the reader in details of scholarly 
  debate.<br>
  <br>
  All Greek is transliterated, with a glossary of Greek terms on p. 77. 
  The plates are well-chosen, well-presented, and follwed by an explanatory 
  commentary. The diagrams, drawn especially for this volume by Richard 
  Mazillius, present clear, uncluttered, and critically-important visual 
  support for the discussion of theatrical topography. The bibliography 
  is divided into subsections for easier reference and consists primarily 
  of works which are not only in current use but also accessible to the 
  Greekless reader at whom his own book is aimed.<br>
  <br>
  The most striking inclusion in the book, however, is the final section, 
  on translation and adaptation. Very few undergraduates-- indeed, very 
  few non- classicists--hear anything more enlightening about the English 
  texts which face them than 'It's better if you read it in Greek.' Directors 
  and playwrights with PhDs and successful careers have been known to regard 
  anyone who reads Greek with an almost superstitious awe. The idea that 
  a translation might be biased never enters their minds. Most translators, 
  and those who write their introductions, seem unwilling to admit that 
  what they are doing is <i>interpreting</i>; published versions of Greek 
  plays rarely so much as acknowledge that the stage-directions which they 
  present are the translator's, not the dramatist's.<br>
  <br>
  Ley presents eight versions of the opening lines of <i>Agamemnon</i> which 
  range from the scholarly through the poetic to Tony Harrison's script 
  for the British National Theatre's well-known 1980 production. Rather 
  than claiming that one style of translation is more legitimate than another, 
  Ley emphasizes the fact that translations do and should vary according 
  to their purpose. A playable script may not serve a student grappling 
  with Aeschylus' Greek for the first time. The translation included in 
  Fraenkel's commentary is not meant for an actor. Adaptations of Greek 
  plays are not treated as desecrations of the original but are presented 
  as a form with its own kind of authenticity and a real place on the stage.<br>
  <br>
  Graham Ley provides an introduction to Greek Theater which is designed 
  to lead the reader to pursue further acquaintanceship with the form on 
  his or her own. Anyone faced with Athenian tragedy or comedy for the first 
  time, in or out of the classroom, would do well to start with <i>A Short 
  Introduction to Greek Tragedy</i>.<br>
