 This is the department's third production of a comedy of Aristophanes. In many ways, it resembles its predecessors in that the format is recognisably Greek but enlivened by wilful anachronism. The production is light in tone until the interval, which follows the induction of Pheidippides into the <i>Thinkery</i>. After this the mood becomes darker, and the <i>peripeteia</i> hinted at earlier by the clouds will be uncompromisingly portrayed. The crass violence in this part of the play will probably not have the same effect on our audience as on Aristophanes'; the director awaits the outcome with interest.<br>
