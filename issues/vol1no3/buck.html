  In this modern and lively new retelling, acted by children ages ten and 
  up, composer and lyricist Cohen has delightfully embellished the tale 
  of Orpheus' descent into the underworld, bringing a 90s sensibility to 
  the classic story of the brave bard who endures a journey to Hades to 
  rescue, and ultimately lose forever, the great love of his life. While 
  the plot remainsintact, Cohen has given the characters far greater dimension 
  than that generally found in more standard versions, raising for them 
  questions of identity and conflicts of relationship which humorously and 
  poignantly add a contemporary resonance to the unfolding story.<br>
  <br>
  As the opera opens, Orpheus is discovered surrounded by his companions 
  the forest creatures, as he tells them how happy he is at the prospect 
  of his marriage to Eurydice, which is about to take place. The wedding 
  guests begin to assemble, and in the song &quot;Can't Turn Back&quot;, 
  Orpheus' male friends tease him about remaining faithful:<br>
  <blockquote> <p>Vultures dance and all the silkworms sing<br>
  Bet your pants fidelity's the thing--can't turn back now. Don't flash  your goods so much<br>
  Your bachelorhood, as such Is in the sack.<br>
  Can't turn back.</font size></p>
  </blockquote>
  The wedding preparations begin, but even the guests detect a discordant 
  note in the proceedings, as they sing the portentous &quot;If All Goes 
  Well&quot;:<br>
   
  <blockquote> <p>Questions abound--<br>
  Hear them creeping?<br>
  Curious sounds<br>
  For wedding day.<br>
  Have the fates found<br>
  What they're weaving;<br>
  What they're leaving<br>
  For wedding day? </p>
  </blockquote>
  While the female chorus readies Eurydice for the ceremony, 
  she begins to get cold feet. She questions Orpheus' notion of &quot;romantic&quot; 
  love -- it seems he spends his time cavorting around in the woods, singing 
  his songs to beasts and flowers, hills and trees- -to everyone and everything, 
  in fact, but Eurydice! Orpheus is in love with the <i>idea</i> of love, 
  but is he truly in love with <i>her</i>?<br>
   
  <blockquote> <p>Eurydice: Sing me your delicate song, sprinkled with  cheer Cozy and queer you make me feel, though I'm not a gathering  throng, I am all ears Are you distressed tonight, tortured and pressed  tonight Orpheus, are you in flight as you stand here? <br>
  <br>
  Orpheus: No, I've got nothing to sing, conditions are poor My throat  is sore, my lyre needs tuning I promise something to sing when things  feel pure <br>
  <br>
  Chorus: You've got a song for trees, wombats and wallabies Sing your<br>
  song for Eurydice. . .</p>
  </blockquote>
  The wedding takes place and, during the dance which follows, 
  an increasingly confused Eurydice wanders alone into the forest, where 
  she encounters a sinuous and sexy snake, who offers to free her from her 
  doubts and fears:<br>
   
  <blockquote> <p> Touch your dreams and trust your balance Stick with  me and you'll go far. Shed your skin and dance with dalliance Are  things what they are, or just what we want them to be? What he wants  is driven by rainbows and ribbons But what <i>you</i> want. . .is  me.</p>
  </blockquote>
   Eurydice, seduced and embraced by the slithery dance, 
  is taken off to Hades, land of the dead. The Gods' messenger Hermes brings 
  the unhappy news to the assembled wedding group, and Orpheus, realizing 
  how much he <i>does</i> love Eurydice, resolves to bring her back to the 
  world.<br>
  <br>
  As his journey to Hades begins, Orpheus must first cross the river Styx. 
  He encounters Charon, the Fagin-like boatman:<br>
   
  <blockquote> <p> I ferry dead souls for a fee I pack em pell-mell  down to Hades to dwell, Yet often I'm told I'm a cheap ne'er-do-well.  What, me? </p>
  </blockquote>
  Charon grants Orpheus passage for the price of a song, 
  and he descends into the 'underground moribund town' of Hades, where he 
  must pass Cerberus, the comically creepy three-headed canine gatekeeper 
  of Hades:<br>
   
  <blockquote> <p> I'm a three-headed<br>
  Six-legged<br>
  Trois-teted<br>
  Dog<br>
  I'm a much hated<br>
  Ne'er sated<br>
  Serrated<br>
  Dog<br>
  I'm a much dreaded<br>
  Non-petted<br>
  Real fetid<br>
  Dog<br>
  Bow wow wow</p>
  </blockquote>
  Inside the gates Orpheus sees the torture of the dead souls, 
  including Tantalus, doomed to eternally struggle for food and water placed 
  just out of reach, and Sisyphus, who continually pushes a rock uphill 
  nearly to the summit where, as if with a mind of its own, the rock returns 
  to the bottom. He is granted audience with King Hades, who, in &quot;It's 
  Never Enough&quot;, reveals that the reasons for the mass torture lie 
  in his own feelings of inadequacy:<br>
   
  <blockquote> <p> How would you feel if your brother was Zeus? The  mind behind humankind; rule of the roost You'd feel pretty small;  forever reduced No matter how hard I try I'll never be him that's  why. . . <br>
  Why am I dark?<br>
  Why am I drear?<br>
  I've got a wife who takes a Spring break half of the year<br>
  A failure in love!<br>
  Is that why I'm here?</p>
  </blockquote>
  Orpheus sings a petition for Eurydice's return to life, 
  and with the beauty of his music the torture momentarily stops--even King 
  Hades is moved. He agrees to allow Eurydice's departure, with the condition 
  that Orpheus must not look at her until both have returned to the world 
  above. Eurydice, unaware of Hades' terms, tells his wife Persephone of 
  her fears of return to life with so many unanswered questions about her 
  relationship with Orpheus. Persephone, in the song &quot;Balance in Season&quot;, 
  relates the story of her own marriage, in which she must spend half the 
  year away to find peace.<br>
  <br>
  As the couple begins their journey home, Eurydice asks Orpheus to turn 
  and look at her; to convince her truly that he really sees her for <i>herself</i>. 
  He does so--there is a fleeting moment of recognition and connection, 
  but Eurydice, who has violated Hades' agreement, must remain below forever. 
  Orpheus, back in the world, finds comfort in the fact that the two will 
  someday be reunited in Hades, wiser about the true nature of their love.<br>
  <br>
  <i>Orpheus and Eurydice</i> was performed on a bare stage; the cast consisted 
  of thirty-odd young actors (including three as Cerberus, and one as Sisyphus' 
  stone!) ranging in age from four to about fifteen. Composer Cohen, also 
  a performer in the pit band, led the energetic young cast through a remarkable 
  variety of musical styles- - jazzy sixties tunes; Sondheim-like Broadway 
  numbers; traditional ballads; even classical arias-- all accessible and 
  catchy. The choreography and costuming were simple yet evocative, using 
  masks, flowing cloth, and the movement of the chorus to create a notion 
  of the stylized symmetry of &quot;traditional&quot; Greek theatre for 
  theatregoers largely unaccustomed to such performances, while maintaining 
  a pace and fluidity appropriate for younger and more contemporary audiences. 
  The opera was given six performances to full and appreciative houses.<br>
  <br>
  The work is a happy blend of the classical and the contemporary. It utilizes 
  elements drawn from myriad styles and genres to create an event which 
  is engaging, humorous, and above all, thought- provoking. While entertaining 
  for the youngest audiences, there is enough meat in the lyrics to allow 
  those more adult spectators to come away affected and even inspired. And, 
  possibly, humming the tunes as well.<br>
  <br>
  Cohen's <i>Orpheus and Eurydice</i> is a welcome new gem in the diadem 
  of the repertoire of work for children and, &quot;If All Goes Well&quot;, 
  will receive the enthusiastic reception and recognition which is its due.<br>
