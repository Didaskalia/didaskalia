  <h3>SUMMER THEATRE WORKSHOP</h3>
  <h4>The Hydra Workshop of Ancient Greek Theatre</h4>
  In the summer of 1995 the Hydra Workshop of Ancient Greek 
  Theatre, in collaboration with Georgia Southwestern College, will offer 
  a unique theatre workshop, lasting six weeks, on the Greek island of Hydra. 
  The island, an artist's colony where cars are prohibited, is two hours 
  away from the summer theatre festivals of Epidavros and Athens. 
  <p> The program will consist of two parallel comprehensive courses: one in the origins, development, and historical background of ancient Greek Drama; and one on practical theatre, involving acting and method group work along with mask-making and movement. In addition, Friday seminars on 'Ancient Greek Theatre in Modern Dress' and a series of lectures from European and American professors will be offered. 
  <p> The Workshop starts on July 3rd and ends August 12th 1995. The program is fully accredited: complete instruction for 12 credit hours (or 8 semester hours). The Workshop's language is English. 
  <p> The climax of the whole program will be a small-scale production of an ancient play involving all students in either acting or technical roles.
