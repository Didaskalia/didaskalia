  <p>Summer Theatre Program at an Ancient Theatre in Greece</p>
  <p><br>
 <br>
 The Department of Theatre and Film at the University of Kansas <br>
 and the community of Katohi (Aitolias/Akarnanias, Greece) are offering a <br>
 summer theatre program in Greece in June and July of 1997. <br>
 <br>
 This program offers students the opportunity to study modern Greek and the <br>
 history of ancient Greek drama while preparing a production of a Greek tragedy <br>
 to be performed in the ancient theatre at Oinaides, near Katohi, a village in <br>
 west central Greece. The faculty, cast, and production assistants will live in <br>
 Katohi and will engage in various cultural exchange programs with the community. <br>
 <br>
 This program is similar to the one offered by Katohi and the University of <br>
 Kansas in 1990, which resulted in a bilingual (modern Greek and English) <br>
 production of Euripides' Hippolytus.<br>
 <br>
 University credit (graduate or undergraduate) available. Early application <br>
 (before January 15, 1997) strongly recommended.<br>

  <p>Conference: Digital Resources for the Humanities 97</p>
  <p><br>
 <br>
 St Annes College Oxford<br>
 14-17 September 1997<br>
 <br>
 Three intensive days of academic papers, panel discussions, technical <br>
 reports, and software demonstrations. Leading practitioners of the <br>
 application of digital techniques and resources in the Humanities, from the <br>
 worlds of scholarship, librarianship, and publishing will be there, <br>
 exchanging expertise, experience, and opinions.<br>
 <br>
 Mission:<br>
 <br>
 DRH97 aims to become a new forum for all those affected by the digitization <br>
 of our common cultural heritage: the scholar producing or using an electronic edition; the teacher using digital media in the seminar room; the publisher finding new ways to reach new markets; the librarian, curator, art historian, or archivist wishing to improve both access to and conservation of the digital information that characterizes contemporary culture and scholarship. <br>
 <br>
 Format: <br>
 <br>
 The conference will take up three intensive days of academic papers, panel <br>
 discussions, technical reports, and software demonstrations, held this year <br>
 in a comfortable Oxford college. The atmosphere will, we hope, encourage a lot of energetic discussion, both formal and informal. Leading practitioners <br>
 of the application of digital techniques and resources in the Humanities, <br>
 from the worlds of scholarship, librarianship, and publishing will be there, <br>
 exchanging expertise, experience, and opinions. <br>
 <br>
 Sponsors: <br>
 <br>
 The conference is sponsored by the British Library, the Office for Humanities Communication, the Arts and Humanities Data Service, the Centre for Computing in the Humanities of Kings College London, the International Institute for Electronic Library Research of de Montfort University, the Library of University College London, and the Humanities Computing Unit of Oxford University. <br>
 <br>
 Themes: <br>
 <br>
 Creation of digital resources, textual, visual, and time-based; integration of digital resources as multimedia; policies and strategies for electronic delivery, both commercial and non-commercial; cataloguing and metadata aspects of resource discovery; pedagogic implications of digital resources and electronic delivery; encoding standards; intellectual property rights; funding, cost-recovery, and charging mechanisms; digitization techniques and <br>
 problems. <br>
 <br>
 Cost and accommodation: <br>
 <br>
 We hope to hold the conference fee at last year's level (&pound;225, covering lunches, dinners, and the whole academic programme). For accommodation, delegates can choose between ensuite rooms at &pound;45/day or study/bedrooms with <br>
 shared bathroom at &pound;30/day for B &amp; B. All accommodation is on campus in <br>
 modern purpose-built blocks adjoining the quadrangle and within a few minutes walk of all conference facilities. The conference banquet will cost an additional &pound;40. <br>

  <p>The Archive of Performances of Greek and Roman Drama</p>
  <p><br>
 <br>
 The Archive of Performances of Greek and Roman Drama, under the joint <br>
 direction of Oliver Taplin and Edith Hall, is a multi-disciplined research <br>
 venture dedicated to establishing an international performance history of <br>
 classical drama on the modern stage. Based at Oxford University's European <br>
 Humanities Research Centre, the Archive will employ a powerful relational <br>
 database in its compilation of a thoroughly cross-referenced register of <br>
 these performances, from the Renaissance to the present day. In conjunction <br>
 with this electronically stored performance history, the Archive will <br>
 include a significant holding of published and unpublished documentation <br>
 pertaining to ancient drama on the modern stage. In the new year the Archive <br>
 will be issuing a call for information and materials relevant to the project.<br>

 <br>
 The mounting of a production of Seneca's Trojan Women, directed by Gyllian <br>
 Raby of the Shaw Festival Theatre, offers an invaluable opportunity for <br>
 scholars to explore whether Seneca's plays received formal production, and <br>
 if they did how they might have been staged. Participants will each be given <br>
 up to an hour to develop and demonstrate their points of view, which touch <br>
 not just upon the plays themselves but also upon the social milieu and the <br>
 influence of Seneca's plays from antiquity to today. Ample time for <br>
 questions will be provided both after each paper and informally.<br>

 <br>
 Iphigenia is a music-theatre piece consisting of two ancient Greek tragedies <br>
 by Euripides, Iphigenia in Aulis and Iphigenia in Tauris.<br>
 Iphigenia is a part of Schrum's projected five play Iphigenia Cycle, that <br>
 will eventually include the three plays of Aeschylus' Oresteia as the <br>
 centerpiece, with these two plays as the framing plays. Due to time <br>
 constraints, the adaptation of the Oresteia will follow later; however, <br>
 Schrum has scripted a brief news show to follow intermission, to inform the <br>
 audience about what happens in the thirteen years between Aulis and Tauris.<br>

 CALL FOR PAPERS for the 1998 MGSA/MLA Panel in San Francisco<br>
 December, 1998<br>
 <br>
 Panel Topic: 'Greek Performance in Context'<br>
 <br>
 Performance study and performance criticism will bring together scholars and <br>
 practitioners from a wide variety of fields in order to discuss practical <br>
 and theoretical issues of (re-)presentation, relating to problems of self, <br>
 gender, orality and literacy, audience interaction, the modernization of <br>
 'dated' Greek texts, meta-theatrical and extra-dramatic performance, <br>
 interaction between spectacle, text, music and dance. In particular, we <br>
 welcome papers addressing the verbal, paraverbal, and visual dimensions of <br>
 nineteenth and early twentieth-century Greek (popular) performance <br>
 (Karaghiozis, Athenian epitheorisi theater, etc.), its social context and <br>
 audience, as well as its analogies with other cultures.<br>

 APA Panel: Unmasked Performance<br>
 <br>
 December 27-30, 1998<br>
 <br>
 Washington, DC For the second year of the three-year APA colloquium on <br>
 Varieties of Performance in the Ancient Mediterranean we ask for submissions <br>
 on 'Unmasked Performance': the performance of ritual, oratory, poetry, or <br>
 song, or of identity in heightened situations. Possible approaches include <br>
 examination of texts for performative markers, use of visual sources, <br>
 reconstruction of bodily aspects (of performed texts or performance within <br>
 texts), or performer- audience interaction. Abstracts ideally should incluse <br>
 a statement of methodology.<br>
 <br>
 The final panel in 1999 will focus on drama.<br>
 <br>
 Abstracts of 500-800 words due by 15 May, 1998.<br>

 DRAMA IN THE CLASSROOM<br>
 <br>
 The Ohio Classical Conference invites submissions for paper abstracts on any <br>
 aspect of ancient drama. We shall consider our theme, 'Drama in the <br>
 Classroom,' broadly. We welcome abstracts on Greek and Roman drama, comedy <br>
 and tragedy, and the archaeology of the ancient theater. We would also <br>
 welcome abstracts on teaching ancient drama and the use of drama itself as a <br>
 teaching method for the Classical languages and Classical Civilization.<br>
 <br>
 Abstracts should not exceed 750 words in length. Presentations ordinarily <br>
 last between 15 and 20 minutes. Please indicate whether you will need any <br>
 special equipment, audio-visual or computer, for your talk. Send five copies <br>
 of the abstract by July 1, 1998 to:<br>

 <br>
 Euripides' surviving work is the main key to our understanding of the <br>
 Athenian tragic theatre in its maturity. This conference will feature <br>
 research by leading scholars of the present and future, consider progress <br>
 since the 1960s, and seek directions for the next generation's work. Four <br>
 broad areas of discussion have been defined: 'Audience and community' <br>
 (coordinator Edith Hall, Oxford), 'Production and staging' (coordinator Eric <br>
 Csapo, Toronto), 'Religious and mythical elements within the plays' <br>
 (coordinator Christian Wildberg, Princeton), 'Tragedy and other genres' <br>
 (coordinator Donald Mastronarde, Berkeley). Other speakers will include Will <br>
 Allan (Oxford), Jane Beverly (Oxford), Claude Calame (Lausanne), John <br>
 Davidson (Wellington), William Furley (Heidelberg), John Gibert (Boulder), <br>
 Barbara Goff (Austin), Simon Goldhill (Cambridge), Richard Green (Sydney), <br>
 Michael Halleran (Seattle), Albert Henrichs (Harvard), Brad Levett <br>
 (Seattle), Christopher Marshall (St John's), Ann Michelini (Cincinnati), <br>
 Judith Mossman (Dublin), John Porter (Saskatoon), Rush Rehm (Stanford), <br>
 Martin Revermann (Oxford), Ruth Scodel (Ann Arbor), William Slater <br>
 (Hamilton), Alexander Stevens (Sydney), Katherine Sweet (Toronto), Oliver <br>
 Taplin (Oxford), Peter Wilson (Warwick), Froma Zeitlin (Princeton). Helene <br>
 Foley (Columbia) will give a keynote address on The Representation of <br>
 Conflict in Euripides. A publication based on the conference proceedings is <br>
 planned. <br>
 <br>
 We invite proposals, preferably by 30 June 1998, for a limited number of <br>
 additional papers, and for contributions in the form of posters or abstracts <br>
 to be presented in written form. Those thinking of attending without making <br>
 a presentation are also asked to notify the conveners as soon as possible.<br>
 <br>
