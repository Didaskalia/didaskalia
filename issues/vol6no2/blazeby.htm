<h1 class="page_title">The Theatre of Pompey: A 3D Jigsaw  Puzzle </h1>
<p><strong>by Martin  Blazeby<br>
 </strong>University  of Warwick, UK</p>
<p>The Theatre of  Pompey, constructed in 55 BC, was the city of Rome's first permanent  theatre and possibly the largest theatre complex ever built. In addition  to the theatre, a large colonnaded garden area and <i>curia</i> building  were erected behind the <i>frons scaenae </i>(stage building). A temple  dedicated to <i>Venus Victrix </i>positioned<i> </i>at the top of  the auditorium rose high above the complex. Tertulian, in <i>De Spectaculis</i> 10.5, records that Pompey had overcome the traditional resistance  at Rome to constructing a permanent theatre by claiming that his structure  was actually only a temple dedicated to Venus with a particularly  prominent range of steps in front of it from which games honouring  the goddess could be viewed. These 'steps' were in fact to become  the largest theatre <i>cavea </i>(auditorium) ever built.</p>
<p>Today the Theatre of Pompey is 
 largely invisible. The remains of the theatre have been swallowed up by subsequent 
 building programs; what can be identified as belonging to the original structure 
 still survives in basements of and around the Palazzo Pio, off the Campo de' 
 Fiori in Rome. In addition, the modern street plan follows the outline of 
 the ancient theatre.</p>
<p>Over the centuries scholars have 
 been intrigued by the Theatre of Pompey as a physical structure, and many 
 studies have been undertaken; however, these have been based on limited archaeological 
 data. The Theatre of Pompey has also captured the imagination of architects, 
 artists and antiquarians who have created various artistic interpretations 
 of the theatre. One antiquarian in particular, the nineteenth-century, architect 
 Luigi Canina, created a series of hypothetical plans and artistic impressions 
 based on his own investigation of the Theatre of Pompey. </p>
<p>In 1999 the UK's  Arts and Humanities Research Board awarded Professor Richard Beacham  at the University of Warwick funds to undertake an extensive new study  of the Theatre of Pompey, with Prof. Jim Packer, Professor of Classics  Emeritus, Northwestern University, USA. Subsequently supported by  Northwestern University, the National Endowment for the Humanities  and other donors, the on-going <a href="http://www.pompey.cch.kcl.ac.uk/">project</a> has consisted of five phases: <br>
</p>
<p>Phase 1: collating  and analysing known historical references and artefacts; <br>
 Phase 2: creating 3D computer visualisations of previous architectural  studies; <br>
 Phase 3: conducting a study of the post-antique history of the site,  by Kristin Triff, Associate Professor of Fine Arts, Trinity College,  Hartford, USA<br>
 Phase 4: carrying out the first ever scientific survey of the site; <br>
 Phase 5: an archaeological excavation. </p>
<p>Phases 1-4 are  complete. Phase 5, which began in June 2003, will culminate in a more  up-to-date, and highly accurate, 3D computer reconstruction of the  theatre complex.</p>
<p>This paper reviews  the generation of an architectural 3D model based on the plans of  Luigi Canina as part of Phase 2, and the problems encountered and  'errors' discovered in his plans. By converting 2D plans into a 3D  model, scholars can truly begin to understand and investigate the  complexities and intricate detailing recorded by Canina in terms of  'virtually' real architectural space. 3D technologies are the only  viable means to offer comprehensible ways of exploring even the smallest  facet of architectural detail which would otherwise be obscured in  2D graphic representations. </p>
<p>Through the process of transforming 
 Canina's 2D plans into a detailed 3D model, inaccuracies in the plans were 
 exposed in a way that could only clearly be seen and understood in 3D. Canina's 
 architectural plans, although they appear to match up and align with each 
 other, in fact began to manifest some major inconsistencies in the measurements, 
 leading to architectural anomalies. Although Canina's plans and drawings are 
 hypothetical and never meant to be realized in 3D, they still constitute a 
 serious study of the ancient theatre, but, simply put, the Theatre of Pompey 
 would not have stood up had it been built from Canina's plans. The inconsistencies 
 in Canina's plans were hidden (deliberately or otherwise) by the ambiguities 
 inherent in 2D graphical representations of 3D space. Only through hours of 
 study and comparing each plan for specific inconsistencies might these errors 
 have come to light. The process of computer modelling, unlike 2D depictions, 
 is unremitting in that components fit together precisely in 3D. </p>
<p>The main inconsistencies between 
 Luigi Canina's drawings of the <i>Elevazione Verso La Cavea </i>(internal 
 cross-section) and the <i>Pianta del Piano Superiore</i> (plan) as revealed 
 by 3D modelling can be seen in Table 1.</p>

<p align="center"><b>Table  1 </b> Comparison of internal cross-section and plan</p>
<p>The dimensions  of the external perimeter of the theatre shown in Canina's plan, internal  cross-section and outer elevation remain approximately the same in  all drawings, however, the dimensions and number of architectural  elements that are represented between the <i>orchestra </i>and the  outer fa&#231;ade wall of the theatre vary considerably. A major disparity  can be calculated in the seating arrangements that are depicted in  both cross-section and plan. The plan contains fewer rows of seats.  Canina has made up for the space lost by the absence of these rows  by increasing the depth of other architectural elements. An example  of this is the <i>praecinctio</i> which is over 2m wider in the plan than shown in the side elevation.</p>
<p>Another inconsistency  can be seen in Canina's positioning of the columns around the <i>porticus  summa cavea</i>. The plan (<b>Fig. 1</b>, right image) shows columns  in a peculiar configuration, situated mid-way down the incline of  the seats of the <i>porticus</i>. In the side elevation (<b>Fig. 1</b>,  left image) by contrast, the columns are positioned level with the  lowest <i>porticus </i>seats, which accords with conventional Roman  architectural practice.</p>

<p><b>Fig.  1 </b>Left image showing side elevation with columns positioned at  the front of the <i>porticus</i>. <br>
 Right image showing plan with columns positioned mid-way through the <i>porticus</i>.</p>
<p>Another peculiarity  is evident in the <i>cavea</i>. The Roman architect Vitruvius, writing  late in the first century B.C., presented in Book 5 of <i>De Architectura</i>,  a detailed description of the geometric layout of an ideal Roman theatre,  based upon a series of mathematical <i>formulae</i>. Canina has drawn  a 'Vitruvian' formulaic circle inside the <i>orchestra</i> showing  that he is using the 'Vitruvian Ideal' as the basis of his theatre  (<i>De Architectura</i> 4.6.1). However, Canina is inconsistent in  his use of this formula; the centre of the Vitruvian circle is not  actually used to determine the central coordinating point; instead,  a different point of origin, approximately 2m behind the central axis  of the circle, is used as shown in <b>Fig. 2.</b></p>
<p><b><a href="images/blazeby/blazebyfig3.htm"><img src="images/blazeby/fig3tn.jpg" width="164" height="94" border="0"><br>
 </a></b><b>Fig.  2 </b>Image showing Canina's use of the Vitruvian circle. <b><br>
 A </b>shows the point of origin for the Vitruvian ideal. <b>B</b> shows Canina's actual point of origin.</p>
<p>Canina's misplaced central point 
 of origin results in the <i>cavea</i> steps running slightly askew, and produces 
 an unusual wedge of seats located in the gap adjacent to the stairways closest 
 to the <i>versura</i> that measures approximately 2m at the uppermost end 
 of the stairs, but which then narrows down to 0m where the steps connect to 
 the <i>praecinctio</i>. It is exceedingly unlikely that the theatre contained 
 such an inelegant architectural anomaly, a conclusion borne out by studies 
 of comparable Roman theatres. </p>
<p>In order to create a 3D reconstruction 
 of the Theatre based on Canina's drawings, the majority of the required measurements 
 were taken from the internal cross-section drawings since these represented 
 two dimensions, vertical and horizontal. An attempt to use a combination of 
 measurements derived variously from both the plan and the outer and internal 
 plans would have resulted in a badly-aligned architectural structure. </p>
<p>The consequent 3D model,  however, highlights even more problems arising from possible errors  in Canina's 2D drawings. One of these is the locations of the massive  range of steps running down from the temple crowning the highest point  of the theatre. According to Suetonius (<i>Claudius</i> 21.1-3), the  Emperor Claudius on one occasion opened games by first sacrificing  at the temple, and then descending slowly down the central stairway  through all the tiers of seats to take his place in the <i>orchestra</i>,  while the thousands of spectators stood in silence. However, in the  3D reconstruction it can clearly be seen that, according to Canina's  drawings, this stairway at its base does not actually connect with  the <i>orchestra</i>. The <i>praecinctio</i> that runs around the  perimeter of the <i>cavea</i> cuts through the temple steps by creating  a barrier wall approximately 1.5m high. <b>Fig. 3 </b>shows this point  clearly, whereas in Canina's plans it is obscured, and consequently  very difficult to perceive the relationship that Canina's structure  demands between the temple's steps and the seating in the <i>cavea</i>.  However, Canina's attempt at 3D realism in his artistic drawing of  the auditorium (<b>Fig. 4</b>) does show the steps connecting the  orchestra to the temple. </p>

<p>Following on  from Canina's study of the theatre, other scholars, including Baltard  of the &#233;cole des Beaux Arts, have added more and more illustrious  interpretations to try and capture the essence of the theatre. Working  closely with Roman archaeological specialist James Packer, we are  able to go one step further by applying marble textures and architectural  ornamentation to the 3D reconstruction of Canina's 2D drawings, based  on actual archaeological evidence from the site. These include <i>porphyry,  giallo antico</i>, <i>granito</i> marbles, and fragments of architectural  mouldings. Using extant evidence from surviving Roman buildings and  using known Roman formulaic construction methods (orders of architecture)  as written about by Vitruvius, we have been able to build upon, and  add to, Canina's original study of the theatre, thus providing a new  and more detailed version (<strong>Fig. 5</strong>)<b>.</b> </p>

<p><b>Conclusion</b></p>
<p>The advent of  3D and VR technology can now enable us to not only investigate the  theatre as a standing structure, but also offers us an understanding  of the sightlines of the performance space, lighting conditions, and  acoustic levels. It also presents us with the ability to calculate  audience capacities and raises myriad other questions that would have  been difficult or imposible for previous scholars to address or, in  some cases, even to formulate.</p>
<p>The resultant  3D model based on Canina's drawings does not illustrate his work;  it corrects and enhances it by unifying the research into a coherent  whole. This in turn enables Canina's hypotheses, and their problems,  to be visualised more accurately, and in turn, this becomes a useful  hypothesis in which to situate our own original research and contribute  to a new 3D reconstruction as part of phase 5 of the <a href="http://www.pompey.cch.kcl.ac.uk/" >Theatre  of Pompey Project</a>. </p>
