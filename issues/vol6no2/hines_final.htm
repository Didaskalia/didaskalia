<p>The remains of  ancient theatre performance spaces lie "at the root of acted language,"  as suggested in the monumental three volume, <i
>Teatri Greci e Romani: alle origini del linguaggio rappresentato</i>. These "mute  stones" speak of cultural performance preferences, adaptive renovations  by ever succeeding societies, and the impact of time and weather and  war. Two centuries of archeological excavations have identified many  of these theatre sites and subsequent research has painted an ever-changing  picture of the historic record that is locked in these tangible remains  of an otherwise ephemeral art.</p>
<p>These magnificent ruins, some pristine, some crumbling,  a few partially restored, many little more than a collection of weathered  stones against a fan-shaped hill, are scattered about the ancient  prefectures of Greece and Rome. The various stories each has to tell  appear in selective compilations of archeological research in numerous  publications including<i
> The History of the Greek and Roman Theater</i>, by Margarete Bieber, and the  aforementioned <i >Teatri Greci e Romani</i>. Vitruvius' <i>Ten Books  On Architecture </i>provide an ancient insight into the Roman as well  as Greek approach to theatre construction, and the detailed second  century travelogues of Pausanias provide selective, eyewitness snapshots  of Greek architecture during the Roman Empire.</p>
<p>The "Virtual Reality Theatre Tour" project was conceived  as an online introductory survey of many of these historic sites.  The resulting website consists of an archive of viewer-controlled  digital panoramic images (360-degree photographs) of numerous historic  theatres as well as a system for linking these images together with  descriptive text as a resource for both students and teachers of theatre  architecture. Although this is not a substitute for an on-site visitation  of an archeological site, the intent of the virtual tour is to augment  traditional teaching methods and provide a dynamic, visual tool for  describing remote archeological sites to students.</p>
<p>It is presumptuous  at best to suggest that the breadth of published research on ancient  theatres can be incorporated into a single website. I would characterize  the <i>Theatre Tour</i> project as an introductory companion to, and  a synopsis of the volumes of scholarly publications addressing the  subject.</p>
<p>A visitor to  the website will find a map of Europe and the Near East.</p>

<p> This map displays  links to numerous historic theatres and when selected, each provides  access to an illustrated historic commentary and data charts containing  dates, dimensions, maps, drawings, timelines, etc. The visitor is  also given the opportunity to take a virtual tour of the ruins. This  virtual tour consists of a series of panoramic views of the theatre  combined with a collection of annotated photographs illustrating,  and hopefully illuminating, significant objects and archeological  details found at the site. </p>

<p>Recent expeditions  by this writer to Turkey, Greece, and Italy have produced over seven  thousand high-resolution photographs of thirty-nine historic theatres.  These digital images were used to create one hundred and fifty-six  panoramic views describing the individual theatres from various vantage  points and select photographs illustrate the various historic commentaries.  The online images represent only a small sample of the total photographic  archive and have reduced resolutions in order to accommodate the restrictions  of Internet access. Until such time that demand overwhelms my college  or my time, the online resource is provided free of charge and requests  for higher resolution images for educational purposes will be considered.  Generous contributions from numerous colleagues have benefited this  project, and I encourage and welcome future offers of scholarship.  Those interested in submitting research or commentaries are encouraged  to contact me at Whitman College. </p>
<p>Although only  the theatres of Turkey are currently online, I am in the process of  editing the images, soliciting commentaries, and building the websites  for the theatres of Greece and Southern Italy. During the next year  these, too, will be incorporated into site-specific tours and linked  to the project map. Photographic expeditions to Northern Italy, France  and Spain are planned in the near future and although the initial  phase of the project concentrates on ancient theatres, I hope to include  later constructions such as the 16<sup>th</sup> Century Teatro Olimpico  in Italy and the 18<sup>th</sup>-Century Drottningholm in Sweden.</p>
<p>The strength  of the <i>Virtual Reality Theatre Tour</i> lies in its specificity,  organization, and accessibility. This is an online archive of historic  theatres and great care has been taken to provide users with an intuitive  approach for comparative explorations of the data. Other websites  of note such as <i >The Perseus Digital Library, Didaskalia: Ancient  Theatre Today,</i> and<i
> Skenotheke: Images of the Ancient Stage</i>, have a much broader base and, in  the case of <i
>Perseus</i>, an amazing depth of information on a vast range of subjects. But,  by limiting the <i>Theatre Tour</i>'s subject matter to historic theatres,  a greater depth of images and text can be provided.</p>
<p>I would be remiss,  however, if I were to imply that reading books or viewing a collection  of panoramic images, annotated photographs, and commentaries is a  substitute for exploring these ancient remains in the settings where  they were built. A virtual tour is not a substitute for travel; it  is merely a convenience. Lacking is the heat of the Syracuse sun  and the relentless wind of Mantinea; missing is the humbling experience  of viewing the plain of the river Kaikos far below the theatre orchestra  at Pergamon. The viewer of a photograph cannot appreciate the longevity  of a Roman drainage system until he has accidentally stepped into  a still functioning, vegetation-obscured, and water-filled orchestra  channel. A paragraph cannot fully describe the visceral experience  of seeing motorcycles assault the slopes of the Sparta theatron and  compare this noise and carelessness with a less damaging modern use  of the orchestra as young boys play soccer in Gytheion a day later.  No description or photo can fully capture the pastoral setting of  sheep grazing among the barely discernable remains of the theatre  at Euromos, overgrown with ancient olive trees and delicate wild orchids.  And finally, no review can possibly convey the majesty of a modern  day performance at Epidaurus as an ancient theatre once again hosts  performers telling an epic story within the confines of an acoustically  perfect bowl of marble.</p>
<p>Rather than admitting  to an inherent weakness unique to the <i>Theatre Tour</i> project,  I am merely acknowledging the universal value of travel and firsthand  experiences. I also acknowledge the impracticality of travel as a  standard pedagogical choice when introducing students to historic  theatre architecture. <i>The Virtual Reality Theatre Tour of Historic  Theatres </i>is not so much a substitute for travel as it is a preparation.  It is a viable resource for presenting ancient theatres to those interested  in the subject, and ideally, it will be an enticement for those so  inclined to travel and explore.</p>
