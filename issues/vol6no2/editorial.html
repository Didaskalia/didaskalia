 <strong><em>Didaskalia</em> Update<br>
 </strong>From  the beginning of October of 2005, <em>Didaskalia</em> will be moving  to a new server at the <a href="http://www.kcl.ac.uk/humanities/cch/" >Centre  for Computing in the Humanities</a> at King's College, London, where  I and the other members of the <a href="http://www.warwick.ac.uk/3d/" >3D  Visualisation Group</a> currently at the University of Warwick will  be taking up new posts. This offers hope of new synergies and opportunities  for <i>Didaskalia</i>, not least a change in the way in which activities  such as editing an e-journal are viewed and supported. The Centre  for Computing in the Humanities is the largest unit of its kind in  Europe, and hosts the UK's Arts and Humanities Data Service, and a  major <a href="http://www.kcl.ac.uk/humanities/cch/methnet/" >ICT  Methods Network</a> funded by the Arts and Humanities Research Council.  </p>
<p>In addition, a  number of members of the Editorial Board have committed substantial  financial assistance to provide technical and administrative support  for at least the next two years. Unlooked-for gestures such as these,  whether of material resources, time or goodwill, enable us to view  the future with confidence &#8211; I am deeply grateful.</p>
<p><i>Didaskalia</i> owes a great debt of gratitude to the Open University, which has provided  hardware, technical and administrative infrastructure, and sub-editing  for <i>Didaskalia</i> since October 2003. I am grateful to Lorna Hardwick,  Carol Gillespie and their colleagues at the OU for their vision and  tenacity over the past year and a half. This invaluable period of  stability has enabled the Journal and website to consolidate and to  develop their resources in both quantity and quality. I am particularly  saddened to be losing Carol Gillespie, who has been a wonderful travelling  companion, and whose contribution to <i>Didaskalia</i> as sub-editor  has been outstanding.</p>

<p><strong>Volume  6 Issue 2: Contemporary Electronic Initiatives</strong><br>
 This issue takes a snapshot of a tiny fraction of the computer-aided  projects and initiatives that are rapidly changing how we study ancient  theatre in performance, and indeed how we create new antiquity-related  artworks and events. </p>
<p>It also marks  the launch of the first public version of <a href="http://didaskalia.warwick.ac.uk">ARCHES</a>,  a new database of visual resources supporting the study of antiquity,  and ancient theatre in particular. In this issue, Mark Childs gives  an account of the <a href="childs.htm">ARCHES Project</a>, its rationale,  and our hopes for future versions of the software.></p>
<p>Since the last  issue was published, extensive additions have been made to the <a href="http://didaskalia.open.ac.uk/studyarea/visual_resources/visualresources.html"> Visual Resources</a> section of the Study Area, including digital  reconstructions of the Odeon of Pericles, the Theatre at Epidaurus,  Greek temporary stages, the Theatre of Pompey in Rome, and Roman temporary  stages, and alternative versions of the Theatre of Dionysus at Athens.  ></p>
<p>The aim of inviting  experts on the application of electronic resources to the study of  ancient drama to write for <i>Didaskalia</i> has been to draw attention  to significant examples of different types of approach, which include  searchable text databases, online multimedia resources, documentary  websites, advanced visualisations, and electronic communication hubs,  and to encourage and assist the reception community to reflect upon  the significance of these developments. </p>
<p>It is easy to  make overblown claims for the transformative effects of the digital  revolution&#151;potential and realisation are two different creatures&#151;but  equally, it can be too easy to allow our daily exposure to digital  technologies, and the aura of 'hype' surrounding them, to desensitise  us to the pace at which that potential is expanding, and some of the  genuinely visionary and important ways in which information and communication  technologies (ICT) could be deployed to expand both our knowledge  and creativity, and our very means of knowing and creating. </p>
<p>Digital communications  have enabled virtual communities to spring into being across the globe,  but in order to be sustainable, these communities need roots in compelling  'real-world' needs and desires. The substantial delays that have beset  the publication of this issue, which have been a source of great frustration  to contributors and editors alike, demonstrates that digital publication  is only as 'instantaneous' as the real people behind it allow. The  challenge for us now is to consider how we, as individuals, project  teams, research groups, clusters, and as a global community, can envision  improved and new means of extending our knowledge and understanding.  I hope that the present issue may contribute to this process of reflection  and debate. </p>
<p>In Europe, three  major research reception initiatives, at the Open University, in Oxford,  and through a European-wide Network, have produced or are producing  significant online databases which will be of inestimable value to  the research community: </p>
<ul>
 <li>Lorna Hardwick reviews the history of the Open University's project on the <a href="hardwick.htm" >Reception of the Texts and Images of Ancient Greece</a>, as it evolved from card index to online database, identifying issues of wider relevance to researchers in the Arts to which such enterprises give rise. </li>
 <li>Platon Mavromoustakos and Gregory Ioannides report on the <a href="mavromoustakos.htm" >European Network of Research and Documentation of Performances of Ancient Greek Drama</a>, and its database.</li>
 <li> Amanda Wrigley describes, illustrates and evaluates the <a href="wrigley.htm" >Database of Modern Performances of Ancient Drama </a>at the University of Oxford.</li>
</ul>
<p> Farther afield, <a href="mueller.htm">Carl Mueller</a> reviews the benefits to the  classical theatre historian of <a href="http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/">The  Perseus Digital Library</a>. These projects are dramatically enlarging  the scope and quality of resources available to the reception community,  and as these contributors show, future developments will continue  to extend our research capacity over the coming years.</p>
<p>In '<a href="donegan_v3.htm">Remediating  Dionysos</a>', Tom Donegan discusses two important and thought-provoking  uses of the Internet in recent years: The Lysistrata Project, turning  the well-worn metaphor of the 'global village' into a reality, exploited  the networking power of the Internet to create the largest theatrical  event in world history, using Aristophanes' comedy as a rallying cry  for protest against the impending war in Iraq. Playwright Charles  ('Chuck') Mee, on the other hand, perceives that adaptation, his preferred  artistic mode, is no less complicit in the fragmentation of 'authority'  than the World-Wide Web, his chosen medium, in the process, producing  a fascinating display of illuminating collisions between the two.</p>
<p>Two of the contributions,  by <a href="baker.htm">Drew Baker</a> and <a href="blazeby.htm">Martin  Blazeby</a>, discuss examples of applications of 3-dimensional visualisation  to the study of the past by the 3D Visualisation Group at Warwick.  The ARCHES project is one outgrowth of these initiatives, which  are gaining increasing prominence in research, teaching and cultural  heritage, and these articles give a glimpse into the workings of two  other major 3D visualisation projects with which the group has been  centrally involved: an ongoing research project into the first and greatest permanent  theatre in Rome, the Theatre of Pompey, and > a study of the visual evidence for Roman temporary stages in ancient  wall paintings using digital 3D visualisations</p>
<p> Four articles  then direct the theme towards digital intiatives that are impacting  upon teaching and learning. The Theatron Project, an  online resource containing extensive information and real-time navigable  3D digital reconstructions of 15 'milestone' stage-types and theatres  in Western theatre history, >is introduced  by Project Co-ordinator <a href="beacham.htm">Richard Beacham</a>,  supplemented by an extensive Guide for Teachers by <a href="eversmann.htm">Peter  Eversmann</a>. </p>
<p>Then, in order  to assess the importance and value to teachers of digital educational  resources relating to ancient drama in teaching contexts, I asked  Craig Morrison to review a number of such resources, including those  created by our own research group. The result is an article jointly-authored  article with Monty McKeand: '<a href="morrison.htm">Classrooms &amp;  Theatres / Learners &amp; Spaces</a>.'</p>
<p>Finally, a different  approach to visualisation, using photographic panoramas to create  'virtual tours' of historic theatres is described here by its creator, <a href="hines.htm">Tom Hines</a>. The <a href="http://www.whitman.edu/theatre/theatretour/home.htm">Theatre  Tours</a> site is an impressive, invaluable, and beautifully presented  resource, drawing upon 'over seven thousand high-resolution photographs  of thirty-nine historic theatres'.</p>
<p>Such projects  are all the more striking when we consider that the first 'world wide  web' page was created as recently as 1990, with the first major public  web browser, Netscape 0.9, released in 1994 (followed by Internet  Explorer 1.0 in 1995). Traditional ideas of 'authoritative' or 'definitive'  scholarship are challenged by more than theories of postmodernism  - the proliferation of digital content makes it inconceivable that  we even can know about, much less master, all that has been said on  a topic. The very notions of memory and remembering are undergoing  a change as we increasingly use computers as prosthetic mental repositories,  and corresponding changes are to be seen in the practice and definition  of cultural remembering, which is to say, history. </p>

<p><strong>Visualisation  and Performance Documentation</strong><br>
 Having explored, experimented with, and reflected upon numerous applications  of computing to teaching and research in the Arts and Humanities for  a little over ten years, I am convinced that visualisation technologies  are now making, and will increasingly make, profound and far-reaching  impacts upon the ways in which knowledge can be acquired, extended  and conceived. In a recent article (abridged and adapted here by kind  permission of its original editor), I argued that this may, in the  first instance at least, be particularly true in the study and practice  of theatrical performance. </p>
<p>Theatrical performance  inscribes itself in space and time through sound and light, scenography  and movement. So, while scholars of written texts enjoy the luxury  of communicating their research through the same medium as the thing  they study, those who seek to write about the form and meaning of  performance forgo the very expressive elements that give performance  its form and meaning. Words and pictures can evoke these in our imaginations,  but can not bring them directly before our senses.</p>
<p>Performance documentation,  however, is not constrained to textual and graphical depictions alone;  using the term 'documentation' in its broadest sense as 'the accumulation,  classification and dissemination of information' (OED 2nd Ed. 1989,  Online Edition), other invaluable forms of documentation include audio  and video recordings. In addition, Virtual Reality technologies are  increasingly being used to simulate the constituent elements of performance.  I believe that this latter development marks the beginning of a genuine  revolution in the methods, theories and practice of performance history.  </p>
<p>To understand  why Virtual Reality (VR) simulations are such a significant departure,  we need to examine their properties in relation to other forms of  performance documentation. To this end, I propose a broad typology  of documents, namely: </p>
<blockquote>
 <p><strong>Text</strong> (play script, archival record, press or academic publication)<br>
  <strong>Depictions</strong> (painting, drawing, choreographical or musical notation)<br>
  <strong>Recordings</strong> (photograph, audio, film video)<br>
  <strong>Simulations</strong> (space, enactment, production)></p>
</blockquote>
<p>For explanatory  clarity, such a typology simplifies a more complex reality, omitting  for instance hybrid forms of documentation such as video recordings  that incorporate footage of paintings, or Virtual environments that  incorporate photographic images, although by identifying the documentary  types that they combine, even the properties of these may be more  clearly understood.></p>
<p>The table below  indicates how user-readers perceive the constituent elements of performance  as mediated by each type of performance documentation. Note: <em>its  purpose is not to show which types of information each form of documentation  can represen</em>t; in this case, text might emerge as among the most  versatile and catholic forms of performance documentation which, as  I have suggested, would be problematic. Rather, it shows how different  types of performance documentation give user-readers a <em>direct,  sensory experience </em>of those elements of performance&#8212;space,  time, sound, lighting, scenography and movement&#8212;that are experienced,  directly and sensorily, by an audience. </p>
<p><a href="images/editorialtableL.jpg"><img src="images/editorialtable.jpg" alt="table indicating how user-readers perceive the constituent elements of performance as mediated by each type of performance documentation" width="509" height="287" border="0"></a></p>
<p> Seen in these  terms, text and notation are the most 'abstract' forms of documentation:  a play script, or textual depiction may evoke a performance's use  of space, time, and sound, but it can not offer readers an immediate <em>experience</em> of how these elements were used in performance.  Likewise, although musical notation depicts sound in printed form,  it does not directly reproduce that sound in the ears of its beholders,  nor the temporal experience of hearing the score performed. </p>
<p>By contrast, although  a painting lacks a performance's elements of durational time, sound  and movement, it can nonetheless provide a sensory experience that  may correspond to aspects of how spectators visually perceive a performance.  That painting and photography employ different technologies, and differ  in their 'status' as documentary evidence, is indicated by their location  within different categories of documentation: 'depictions' and 'recordings'  respectively. Recordings mediate more directly than depictions between  performance and user-readers of the 'document'. While the experience  of spectatorship is likely to be quite different, film and video are  nevertheless capable of giving viewers an experience of the performance  that draws upon the senses in a way that is not unlike the way in  which a performance draws upon the senses of its audience. However,  the table also shows that both painting and photography address the  visual senses of their viewers in broadly the same way. </p>
<p>As an instrument  of theatre-historical documentation, however, even recordings have  severe limits. For instance, they are constrained to those places  and performances that coincided with the availability of recording  technologies, and the opportunity and willingness to use them. Consequently,  the history of theatre during the two-and-a-half millennia predating  the invention of technologies for recording sound, and static or moving  images has to rely on older forms of documentation. Nor can we choose  retrospectively to train microphones and cameras on performances that  only years later come to be of interest to the historian. </p>
<p>As for simulations,  a spatial simulation (S) might consist of an actual, full-size recreation  of a place of performance, such as Shakespeare's Globe on London's  South Bank, or a physical miniature, or a digital model. In each case,  the senses required to perceive the place of performance are similarly  employed in perceiving the 'document.' When a spatial simulation is  conjoined with a real or Virtual enactment (E) that reconstructs one  or more aspects of a past, style or tradition, the result (S + E)  is a complete production, a new type of documentation that provides  a striking degree of sensory consistency with its object. </p>
<p>More striking  still is the possibility that such simulations might also require  us to redefine the very boundaries of 'documentation' itself. 'Documentation'  as we currently think of it, presumes the pre-existence of information  that is to be accumulated, classified and disseminated. Simulation  does not: the making and exploiting of a simulation, whether real  or Virtual, not only accumulates and disseminates information, it  may actually <i>produce </i>information. Simulations, by synthesizing  vast and diverse sets of information, almost invariably allow us to  perceive previously invisible relationships. </p>
<p>Simulations are  necessarily at one further remove from what they document than are  recordings, and constitute 'objects', 'spaces' and 'performances'  in their own right; rather like translations or adaptations of prior  plays, the creative and interpretative trajectories of simulations  also deserve and require critical attention. At the same time, three-dimensional  simulations of spaces can also augment photographic documentation  by pasting or projecting photographs onto three-dimensional architecture,  thereby synthesizing recorded with simulated information. Simulations  can thus enable viewers to experience other types of documentation  in more dimensions than previously possible. Consequently, subjecting  two-dimensional sources to three- and four-dimensional examination  very frequently reveals errors and <em>lacunae</em>. </p>
<p>Once a space has  been simulated, viewers can enter it and walk around it, acquiring  a completeness of sensory experience of the space otherwise impossible  to acquire. When a research process organizes its resources, methods  and questions around the creation of a three- or four-dimensional  object or event (rather than, say, a printed text), a different kind  of engagement with the object of study is attained. It is a quality  of attention to the material and dynamic properties of the performance,  not unlike the thorough and in-depth attention that a translator gives  to a text. As an intervention in the field of human representations,  simulation involves a no less theoretically or technically complex  set of cultural and representational transactions. </p>
<p>It is no exaggeration  to say that, through simulation, we not only see things anew; we also  acquire new ways of seeing and knowing. Less directly, the expertise  required to create historical spatial simulations and historically-based  enactments exceeds the knowledge and skills of any one scholar. Simulation-based  research must therefore always be multi-partner, and interdisciplinary,  intensifying the exchange, cross-fertilization and creation of knowledge.  </p>
<p>While useful in  its own way, a two-dimensional table such as the above can not hope  adequately to triangulate the immensely complex and varied interrelations  between performance, documentation, and reader-response, or to chart  the kinaesthetic and sensory dimensions of spectatorship or stage-spectator  interaction. One such instance is the difference between real and  Virtual simulations. On the face of it, real reconstructions of historical  performances and places of performance ought to be the form of 'documentation'  that provides the closest sensory analogue to its object. Above all,  there can be no substitute for simply being there; for many, the immediacy  and unrepeatability of a live performance, and the intensity of spectatorship  experience that this produces, is the very essence of performance.  Simulation, with real spaces and bodies alone can claim to overcome  the cardinal limitation of documentation with which we began. </p>
<p>It comes at a  cost, however, both financial and functional. Few can afford physically  to reconstruct a lost theatre or the trappings of performance. And,  once created, it is difficult to modify a physical space in the light  of changing evidence or emerging scholarly consensus. Nor can a real  production easily explore all conflicting interpretations of the historical  evidence. For a 'real' production to survive as an historical source,  other forms of documentation such as text, photography, and film,  must be brought to bear upon it, with their attendant conventions  and limitations. And once the record is set, no further changes can  be made after the fact. What a real simulation gains as performance,  it sacrifices in efficacy as a form of historical documentation. </p>
<p>For these reasons  and others, Virtual Reality technologies often offer more affordable  and flexible alternatives to 'real' reconstructions of historical  performances and places of performance. Virtual spaces and performances  can readily be modified, juxtaposed with alternative hypotheses. Virtual  spaces can be distributed worldwide, simultaneously and collectively  experienced by users separated by real space. Virtual space can also  be a kind of 'hyperspace' &#8211; the spatial, superceding the textual,  metaphor &#8211; transporting the user to a potentially infinite galaxy  of virtual spaces, or from four-dimensional space-time back to the  two-dimensional world of hypertext. In hyperspace, information and  structure are integrated in ways of which reality can only dream:  places and performances become portals through which rich documentary  and interpretative content flows, incorporating texts, depictions,  recordings and simulations. Virtual Reality's capacity to collate,  synthesize and enhance all other types of documentation that have  gone before makes it into a form of 'Ur-documentation'.</p>
<p>In <em>Avatars  of the Word,</em> James J. O'Donnell reminds us of Marshall McLuhan's  claim that 'the content of a new medium of communication is always  imagined in another older medium'. O'Donnell elaborates: 'it takes  several generations to get past the point of depending on the old  medium for a way to think about the new and to get to the point of  exploring the new medium in its own right' (1998, 42). Consequently,  no first generation of a major information technology transition,  such as we are currently undergoing, can possibly force or predict  its trajectory of influence &#8211; such paradigm shifts are too monumental  to be contained within existing models of 'how things work', or even  of 'how things could work'. Having said that, as Toph Marshall has  reminded me, information technology generations now succeed each other  every four or five years, posing unprecedented learning challenges  and opportunities to the much more slowly revolving human generations.  </p>

<div class=Section1>Recent years have seen the development of different types of electronic games and game-like environments, including:<br>

<ul>
 <li>
  <div class=Section1>Massively Multi-player On-line Role-Playing Games (<a href="http://www.gamesites200.com/mpog/" >MMORPGs</a>)<br>

<div class=Section1>
 <p>MMORPGs, which  began to become widely available in the mid-1990s, and Shared Virtual  Reality Environments now boast an extraordinary diversity and quality  of content and functionality, while running easily on today's 'entry-level'  computers. Typically, subscribers begin their virtual lives by customising  the appearance (and often aptitudes and characteristics) of their  avatar (virtual person), through which they will interact with and  within the world. Once online, they encounter a virtual environment  inhabited by tens of thousands of other users, with whom they can  speak, compete with, collaborate on tasks, conduct business, or form  relationships. The three-dimensionality and interactivity of these  virtual environments, together with the invitation, through avatar-based  interaction, to perceive and experience the virtual environment in  a way that is highly analogous to aspects of 'real-world' sense-perception,  creates a highly compelling&#151;for many, troublingly addictive&#151;alternative  to reality. Such changes in cognitive processes have epistemological  implications to which syllabi and research questions and methods must  quickly respond if we are to provide education adequate to our students'  needs, or adequately to equip new generations of teachers and researchers.</p>
 <p>The subscribers  of MMORPGs, Educational Games, Alternative Reality Games and Shared  Virtual Reality Environments (non-competitive Virtual Worlds) are  now counted in millions. An OECD report published just a few weeks  ago observes that EverQuest, one of the three most popular Virtual  Worlds today, generates monthly revenues of EUR 8-9 million (Beinisch <em>et al.</em> 2005, 8). The largest MMORPG, a Korean version of  a game called Lineage by NCSoft, has 4 million players, hundreds of  thousands of whom spend as much time each week in the online gaming  environments as they do at work or attending school or college, contributing  to annual revenues of $1.34 billion generated by the online gaming  industry in 2003 (Beinisch <em>et al</em>. 2005, 7 &amp; 22). Virtual  money exchanges hands both for 'in-world' products and services, and  for 'real-world' money through ancillary websites. In December 2004,  one investor paid <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/technology/4104731.stm" >US$26,500</a> for a piece of digital land in Project Entropia, and in a study published  as early as 2001, economist Edward Castronova observed that the GNP  per capita of a Virtual World called Norrath 'easily exceeds that  of dozens of countries, including India and China.' (Castronova 2001,  4). </p>
 <p>Gaming technologies  and their economies are driving important social and cultural changes  that research and education communities can not afford to ignore.  Non-competitive Shared Virtual Reality Environments, such as <a href="http://secondlife.com" >Second  Life</a> and <a href="http://www.project-entropia.com" >Project  Entropia</a>, are particularly suggestive in this respect. In <a href="http://secondlife.com">Second  Life</a>, for instance, I have visited historical reconstructions  of Art Deco public buildings, fascinating investigations of sense  perception involving disorientating distortions of scale, and a simulation  by the University of Kansas allowing users to experience through their  avatars the symptoms of paranoid schizophrenia. Within a couple of  weeks, my guide had caused a virtual reconstruction of the Theatre  of Dionysos to be constructed, which up to 50 avatars could visit  at any one time and in which virtual performances, complete with masks,  costumes, music, dance and gesture, could be created by self-taught  home users. The pedagogical applications appear to be boundless, so  it is not surprising that a number of universities have begun to acquire  virtual land to teach and conduct experiments across a number of disciplines.  </p>
 <p>The creation of  historical narratives is performative inasmuch as it makes 'the past'  present, so that there is an elegant symmetry between the object and  nature of our study; that is, between historically-informed performance  and the performativity of historiography. Or, to put it differently,  as acts of cultural remembering, antiquity-related performance and  the writing of histories are both to a significant degree reworkings,  adaptations, versions and translations of traces of the past. A further  symmetry is now emerging between the virtual worlds that are created  by the art of the theatre, and those now burgeoning across global  digital matrices. Whether our primary concern is to further our knowledge  and understanding of drama in antiquity, or of the influence of ancient  drama upon the theatre and performance of later ages, or of how we  might allow present performances to be informed by those of the past,  we now have more widely affordable, accessible and flexible means  at our disposal to think and work spatially and dynamically as well  as textually and statically and, in addition to the more traditional  modes of solitary and disciplinary research, to develop our models  of interactive and interdisciplinary enquiry. Semantic symmetries  between history and performance are now beginning to converge in practice:  within digital domains, historians are performing as well as writing  histories, while artists are finding new means of travelling through  time and space. </p>
