<h1 class="page_title">The APGRD Database  of Modern Performances of Ancient Drama at the University of Oxford<br>
</h1>
<strong>by Amanda Wrigley</strong><br>
Archive of Perfomances of Greek and Roman Drama,<br>
University of Oxford, UK.
<p>The <a href="http://www.apgrd.ox.ac.uk/events.htm" >Archive of Performances  of Greek and Roman Drama</a> (APGRD) was founded in 1996 by Edith  Hall and Oliver Taplin in response to the need for a coordinated research  effort devoted to the international production and reception of ancient  Greek and Roman plays from the Renaissance to the present day. Funded  initially by the Leverhulme Trust (1996-1999) and subsequently (1999-2004)  by a Research Project grant from the UK's Arts and Humanities Research  Board (AHRB), the project has for some years been working to establish  the international history of ancient plays in modern performance,  primarily on the stage, but also on film, television and radio, and  in opera and dance. From October 2004 the APGRD has been engaged in  a new, five-year AHRB (now AHRC) research project which grows organically  from these foundations, developing theoretical models for the scholarly  practice of performance reception, collecting all the information  that can be discovered about identifiable performances in antiquity,  and turning to further kinds of performance and interpretation in  the modern period, in particular studying opera and dance more systematically  than we have so far been able to do.</p>
<h2>Purpose</h2>
<p>The central purpose  of the APGRD is research, and the publication of several books (see  below) has arisen from a full programme of lectures and conferences.  A further major research output will be the publication of the <i>APGRD  Database of Modern Performances of Ancient Drama</i>. The APGRD also  serves as a repository of physical materials relating to the stage  history of the ancient plays in performance, such as posters, flyers,  theatre programmes, tickets, newspaper reviews, designs, photographs  and audio-visual recordings. The basis of this collection is the personal  archives of the APGRD's founding Directors, Edith Hall and Oliver  Taplin, who together with colleagues Peter Brown (Director), Fiona  Macintosh (Senior Research Fellow), Pantelis Michelakis (Honorary  Research Fellow), Amanda Wrigley (Researcher), and Christopher Weaver  (Administrative Assistant) continue to work tirelessly to source new  materials from archives, libraries, and theatre companies. In addition,  we have recently benefited from the expertise of Dr Vasiliki Giannopoulou  who has been working on the post-Renaissance reception of Aristophanes.</p>
<h2>Events</h2>
<p>An international  conference is held every three years, on <i>Medea </i>and <i>Agamemnon </i>in performance  in 1998 and 2001 respectively, and on the performance reception of  Aristophanes' <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Peace</i>,<i > Birds </i>and<i> Frogs</i> in September 2004. In addition, a regular public lecture  series has brought a rich variety of performing arts practitioners,  translators, and academics from many disciplines to Oxford to share  their knowledge and experiences (the complete list of speakers is  available <a href="http://www.apgrd.ox.ac.uk/events.htm" >online</a>). A colloquium on 'Iphigenia  in the Arts' took place at the University of Bristol in May 2004 under  the auspices of the APGRD and <a href="http://www.bris.ac.uk/arts/birtha/centres/institute">Bristol's  Centre of the Classical </a><a href="http://www.bris.ac.uk/arts/birtha/centres/institute">Tradition</a>.  Moreover, for the past four years the APGRD has joined with the <a href="http://www.rhul.ac.uk/Drama/">Department  of Drama and Theatre</a><a href="http://www.rhul.ac.uk/Drama/"> at Royal Holloway</a>, University of London to organise an  annual two-day <a href="http://www.apgrd.ox.ac.uk/events.htm">Postgraduate  Symposium</a> on the modern performance of Greek drama.It has also  supported 'Dionysus Recast', a postgraduate seminar series held each  summer term from 2003 to 2005 at the University of Oxford. In addition,  the APGRD has benefited from close collaboration with the Open University's <a href="http://www2.open.ac.uk/ClassicalStudies/GreekPlays">research  project</a> on The Reception of the Texts and Images of Ancient Greece  in Late Twentieth-century Drama and Poetry in English (see <a href="hardwick.htm">Hardwick</a> in this issue) and the wide membership of the <a href="http://www.cc.uoa.gr/drama/network">European  Network</a> of Research &amp; Documentation of Ancient Greek Drama  Performances (see <a href="mavromoustakos.htm">Mavromoustakos</a> and <a href="ionniades.htm">Ionniades</a>). </p>
<h2>Publications</h2>
<p>These activities  have led to the publication of two collective volumes: a diachronic  survey of a single tragedy, <i>Medea  in Performance, 1500-2000 </i>(Oxford: Legenda, 2000), and a synchronic<i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'> </i>study of the revival of the Greek tragic  repertoire in the later twentieth century, <i >Dionysus Since 69:  Greek Tragedy at the Dawn of the Third Millennium</i> (OUP, 2004).  Two further volumes are now in press: <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Agamemnon in Performance, 458 BC-2004 AD</i> (OUP, November 2005) breaks new ground by tracing this play's performance  reception from antiquity to the present; and Edith Hall and Fiona  Macintosh's book, <i>Greek Tragedy  and the British Theatre,</i> <i>1660-1914 </i>(OUP, July 2005), investigates the reception of ancient tragedy  in one country. The volumes on <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Medea </i>and <i >Agamemnon </i>arise out of  the proceedings of our conferences on these plays; <i>Dionysus  Since 69</i> arises out of our twice-termly lecture series, with the  addition of chapters by all members of the research project; and <i>Greek  Tragedy and the British Theatre </i>is the sole work of Edith Hall  and Fiona Macintosh. The proceedings of our conference on 'Aristophanes  Upstairs and Downstairs: <em>Peace</em>, <em>Birds</em>, and <em>Frogs</em> in Ancient and Modern Performance' will appear in book format.

<h2>APGRD Database</h2>
<p>Each of these  four (published or in press) books includes a substantial production  chronology of some kind which is in effect a snapshot of a section  of the <a href="http://www.apgrd.ox.ac.uk/database">APGRD Database</a>. This electronic research resource makes available  online data on over 8,000 works of modern performance which draw on  ancient Greek and Roman drama, and bibliographical references to enable  the researcher to consult a range of evidence on each production.  Even in its developmental stage, this electronic resource has proved  to be an invaluable research tool for an international body of scholars  in a wide range of disciplines and specializations, from those investigating  the performance history of a particular play, for example, to those  seeking to map the cultural history of a particular country in a specific  decade.</p>
<h2>(i) Production  details</h2>
<p>The performing  arts can be complicated: since much of the data used to identify and  describe works of performance in the database can exist in multiple  values, it is of the utmost importance that all the data can be recorded  in a searchable way. If a production of <i>Medea</i>, drawing on the  ancient plays of that name by both Euripides and Seneca, in a modern  adaptation created by using two early 20th-century translations, is  performed with English dialogue and modern Greek songs, as a collaborative  effort between two theatre companies, under two directors, and touring  internationally to numerous venues and festivals over a period of  three years, then there must be a facility for locating this record  in the database using any combination of these values. The database  has therefore been designed with a sophisticated query facility enabling  the researcher to access records from a wide selection of 'entry points':  for example, chronological (year ranges), geographical (country, location,  and venue), by person (translators, directors, actors, designers),  theatre company, language of performance, type of performance (e.g.  stage, dance, musical, puppetry), the modern texts used to form the  playscript, and, of course, by the ancient play(s) on which the modern  work of performance draws. </p>
<h2>(ii) Bibliographical  references</h2>
<p>In addition to  the presentation of these hard facts, a vital function of the database  is to point the researcher in the direction of bibliographical sources  which will offer further information on productions: for example,  reviews, articles and listings in the press; academic books and journal  articles; histories of theatre companies and venues; published playtexts;  books by or about theatre practitioners; and standard reference works. </p>
<p> Links to other  websites are also provided as a further type of published 'evidence'  for productions. Although websites are a rich source of information,  their ephemerality has serious implications for the currency of the  references which are provided by the database. The database is, at  this stage of publication, a purely textual resource, and does not  include any image, video or sound files, due to the financial resources  that would be required to develop the database to hold such files  with regard to current best practice, and to digitize the entirety  of the APGRD's archival resources for over eight thousand works of  performance. Rather, the database aims, by providing bibliographical  references, to act as an effective jumping-off point from which the  international research community can continue its investigations at  local research libraries.</p>
<p>The 'production  details' about works of performance contained in bibliographical sources  have been transferred to the database, but the contextual information  surrounding these facts cannot efficiently be held by a database.  So, although the database has been designed to hold a complex level  of data &ndash; such as that in the 1977 New York Shakespeare Festival production  of <i>Agamemnon </i>directed by  Andrei Serban, Priscilla Smith took the roles of both Clytemnestra  and Cassandra at the Vivian Beaumont, but that when the production  transferred to the Delacorte these roles were played by two actors,  Gloria Foster and Dianne Wiest &ndash; it cannot easily explain why this  change of cast was made.</p>
<p>The bibliographical  references will also provide the researcher with the tools to verify,  and perhaps sometimes disagree with, the information provided by the  database. Often subjective decisions have to be made relating to the  interpretation and prioritization of the variety of evidence available  on a production: for example, a production may be advertised as a  'version' of an ancient play, but after seeing the play in performance  or looking carefully at the playscript it may be thought more appropriate  within the reference terms of the database to describe the production  as a translation of that ancient play. Often, the sources of evidence  for the ephemeral activities of the stage can contradict each other,  and it is therefore incumbent on the researcher to make an independent  assessment of the bibliographical (and other) sources listed for a  production. The database is therefore only the starting point for  independent, interpretative research.</p>
<h2>Advantages  of electronic publication</h2>
<p>The overwhelming  advantage of electronic over hard-copy publication for such a reference  work is that newly-discovered productions can be added at any point,  and the data on productions already recorded in the database can be  continually revised and expanded as new sources come to light. The  process of data collection on a production can be haphazard and incremental:  after stumbling across a passing reference to a production of an ancient  drama in the biography of an actor, for example, some time may pass  before an email to the theatre company involved yields a theatre programme  for our collection and therefore new information for our database.  And so the information held by the database expands incrementally  not only in terms of new productions but also in terms of the depth  of data held on known productions. </p>
<p>A further advantage  of electronic publication for several thousand records is that the  data can be accessed through a variety of different entry points:  for example, a combination of geographical and chronological search  terms can provide an interesting report of what was happening in a  particular place at a particular time; a search for all known productions  of Aeschylus' <i >Agamemnon </i>will return a list of over 700 productions  across the globe; and a search for Steven Berkoff will bring up a  list of those productions in which he was involved either as an actor  or a director, as well as all those productions which have used his  adaptations of <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Agamemnon </i>and <i >Oedipus Tyrannus</i>.  The database has been designed with a feedback form in the hope that  researchers using the resource will inform the APGRD when they discover  errors in the data or have supplementary material &ndash; in terms of both  productions and sources &ndash; to contribute.</p>
<h2>Solutions  to the problem of documenting the performing arts</h2>
<p>The ephemeral  nature of the theatrical event means that it is publicly documented  for only a short length of time. Evidence may be preserved in the  form of a newspaper review, magazine article or theatre programme,  but for many productions once the theatrical event is over information  about it disappears from immediate sight. Theatre companies who can  afford to maintain a substantial web presence are increasingly sensing  the importance of archiving web pages on past productions. Documentation  in the performing arts can be patchy and disorganised, and the printed  record of a performance can be unreliable even in specialist journals  and magazines. Secondary sources such as newspaper reviews can mis-spell  actors' names and report the dates of the run incorrectly, and even  advance publicity from a theatre company might advertize a tour that  in fact never happened. Relying on such secondary printed sources  for data collection on a performance event is therefore problematic,  but it remains one of the most fundamental methods of data collection  for the database.</p>
<p>The approach  taken during data entry is one of rigorous cross-checking of data  whilst keeping in mind the relative merits of different types of source.  A piece of documentation from a theatre company (figs 1, 2 &amp; 3)</p>

 Fig. 4</p>
<p>however, a sudden  change of cast during the run of a production, for example, will not  always be reflected in the programme. A reference to a production  in an academic article might mis-remember the premi&#232;re of the initial  run, but it might contain valuable information on a revival and tour  three years later. And so, the information on the database will only  reflect those sources which have come to the attention of the APGRD  team at that point in time. Every attempt has been made to examine  and cross-check data in order that it reaches the research community  at an appropriately scholarly standard, but it is the hope of the  research project that users of this resource will treat it as a springboard  to propel them into a deeper investigation of the history of a particular  production.</p>
<h2>How it  works in practice</h2>
<p>The database  has been designed in the style of a standard academic library catalogue  so that researchers can 'drill down' into the data, following leads  of interest as they arise. A search for all productions of Euripides' <i >Iphigenia at Aulis </i>performed internationally in the last decade  (fig 5) returns  an overview list of 47 records (fig. 6 ).

<h2>Future  datasets</h2>
<p>In addition to  the conferences, lectures, and books which will emerge from the new  project from October 2004, its research will also generate three substantial  datasets for electronic publication. These datasets will make use  of some of the fundamental tables and relationships drawn in the current  APGRD database. Building on existing foundations in this way will  enable the researcher to search the three new datasets either independently  from, or in tandem with, the APGRD database.The new datasets will  be as follows:</p>
<p>1. Records for  the performance of drama in antiquity from c.500 BC to c.500 AD, and  documentation of the evidence for their performance. The performance  of drama in antiquity will&#151;in addition to tragedy, comedy, and  satyr play&#151;include pantomime, parodic mime, tragoedic recital  and citharoedic recital on theatrical themes. Documentation for their  performance will refer to source materials such as papyrus, vase-painting,  inscription, scholion and treatise. Our new AHRB-funded doctoral researcher,  Rosie Wyles at the University of Durham, is investigating the performance  reception in antiquity of Euripides under the supervision of Edith  Hall, and the findings of this research will be of great importance  for the design of the new electronic resource. </p>
<p>2. An index of  c.1,500 operas composed from the early modern period to the present  which draw on ancient drama, and several thousand records detailing  performances of them.</p>
<p>3. A similar  index of c.1,000 ballets choreographed from the early modern period  to the present which draw on ancient drama, and records detailing  performances of them.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>The APGRD Database  of Modern Performances of Ancient Drama has been designed to provide  the research community with an efficient tool with which to access  a rich and complex set of data on the performance of ancient drama  on stage, film, television and radio. It is intended that the potential  value of this resource will be realized with the emergence of further  interdisciplinary works which endeavour to investigate, contextualize  and interpret the data, thus proving it to be an indispensable instrument  for those working in the field of reception studies.</p>
