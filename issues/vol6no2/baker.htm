<p>As part of an  ongoing programme of research the 3D Visualisation Centre at the University  of Warwick has been using 3D computer modelling to evaluate and extend  our understanding of the relationship between Pompeian frescos and  actual Roman theatre practice.</p>
<p>The Centre's work  includes studies of several frescos depicting possible stage structures,  taken from buildings in Pompeii and nearby Oplontis (modern-day Torre  Anunziata):</p>
<ul>
 <li> the House of Apollo </li>
 <li> the House of the Ara Maxima </li>
 <li> the House of the Cryptoporticus </li>
 <li> the House of Marcus Lucretius Fronto </li>
 <li> the House of Obellius Firmus </li>
 <li> the House of Pinarius Cerialis </li>
 <li> the House of Siricus </li>
 <li> the House of the Vettii </li>
 <li> the Villa at Oplontis </li>
</ul>
<p>the National Archaeological  Museum at Naples:</p>
<ul>
 <li> a depiction of Medea and the Peliades </li>
</ul>
<p>and sites on the  Palatine in Rome:</p>
<ul>
 <li> the House of Augustus </li>
 <li> the House of Livia </li>
</ul>
<p>Researchers in  the team are currently preparing detailed analyses individual and  collections of paintings for publication. This article describes one  particular study: testing the hypothesis that there is a correlation  between a fresco in the Terme del Sarno and the stage of the Great  Theatre at Pompeii.</p>
<p>The fresco in  the so-called Terme del Sarno depicts a number of nude human figures  who appear to be celebrating victories in athletic contests. However,  the structure in which they are displayed strongly resembles a Roman  theatrical stage of the period, and does not obviously correspond  to any other known type of structure. </p>

<p>The <i>podium</i> provides the base for a busy combination of aedicules, hemicycles  and projections painted in the red-orange-gold spectrum, defined and  punctuated by a small forest of slender columns. The walls and doors  rising from the <i>podium</i> rather surprisingly reach only to elbow  height of the athletes, while above and beyond them, picked out in  shades of blue, lies an elegant and delicately detailed array of receding  architectural vistas. Theatrical masks commonly appear as a decorative  element in Roman wall paintings, but the unusually large scale of  the masks placed upon half-walls at either extent of this fresco&#151;about  twice the size that any of the depicted human figures could wear&#151;suggest  that they may in addition be designed to amplify the theatrical associations  of the setting.</p>

<p>The hypothesis  that part of the structure of the scene depicted in the fresco seems  closely to match parts of the extant physical remains of the Great  Theatre at Pompeii was first put forward by Von Cube in 1906 (see  also Bieber, 1961: 232). </p>

<p>This article gives  a non-technical overview of the problem and our responses to it, rather  than providing a detailed breakdown of the extensive, complex calculations  involved. Its purpose is to establish for a readership interested  in ancient drama in performance that modern 3D visualisation techniques  have an important part to play in the assessment of existing, as well  as the advancement of new, research hypotheses in this area. </p>
<h4><br>
 <em>Summary of the Reconstruction Process</em></h4>
<p>All reconstruction  processes require two initial reference items: </p>
<blockquote> (a) a plan or plans upon which to base the reconstruction<br>
 (b) a starting point to give a fixed point of reference for scale. </blockquote>
<p> Using these two  items, it is possible to extend the two-dimensional perspectival depiction  into three dimensions, and to interpolate this new three-dimensional  structure into the physical space of the actual theatre.</p>

<p>Human  representations within frescos cannot be assumed to be to scale; they  vary in size apparently relative to their importance within the scene.  If they are intended to depict statues, the question of scale is equally  impossible to gauge. Therefore an alternative point of reference to  human figures must be found. </p>
<p>Figure  1, below, shows a plan of the Great Theatre at Pompeii (Maiuri 1951,  reproduced in Bieber 1961, fig. 608) overlaid with Von Cube's hypothetical,  schematic plan of the structure depicted in the Terme del Sarno fresco  (red). </p>

<p> When the <i>pulpitum</i> of the actual theatre is lined up with the <i>pulpitum</i> depicted in the  fresco plan, the relationship between the two structures' perspectival  lines can be traced, as in Figure 2 below.</p>
<p><a href="images/baker/bakerfig02.jpg"><img src="images/baker/bakerfig02tn.jpg" width="135" height="94" border="0"></a><br>

<p>Unlike the actual  theatre, in the fresco the articulated section of the <i>pulpitum</i> and the <i><em>frons scaenae</em> </i>are same width. I therefore  propose a viewing position which, in the actual theatre, would achieve  this effect as the perspective implied by the fresco. This gives a  point of reference for depth and scale. Taking this element as the  0 point on the horizontal axis, it is possible to start calculations.</p>
<p>Working from the  'front' of the depiction backwards a number of observations and comparisons  between the fresco and the theatre can be made.</p>
<p>Using Vitruvian  formulae, the height of the fresco's <i>pulpitum</i> should be approximately  1.147m. Placing the fresco's <em>pulpitum</em> into the corrected  perspective gives it a height of 1.3m, within only 15cms of the Vitruvian  'ideal'. (The fresco painter's perspectival adjustments, if uncorrected,  would have implied a <i>pulpitum</i> of twice this height: 2.6m.)<br>
 <br>
 The fresco's stage appears to have a platform in the middle of the  curved niche which roughly equates to the two stand-alone podia/column  bases in front of the central opening in the actual theatre's <em>frons  scaenae</em>. On the criterion of Vitruvius, these columns (and the  others depicted) appear either to be either non-structural elements,  or to have been aesthetically altered in their proportions for the  sake of the fresco. (There is no evidence in Vitruvius to suggest  that the proportions of wooden architecture normally differed from  those of masonry.)</p>
<p>The purpose of  doorways in a <em>frons scaenae</em> is to allow an actor movement  between the fore-stage and rear-stage areas and to conceal back stage  movements. Similarly, non-doorway panels allow actors to move about  the rear of the stage unseen. Adjusted, both doors and panels in the  fresco are sufficiently high to hide the stooped actor, or to reveal  the head and shoulders of an actor if required - a device often associated  with ornamental masks on frescos of this nature, and indeed visible  on the extremes of this fresco.</p>
<h4><em>Real vs.  Fantastical</em></h4>
<p> The next task  is to attempt to establish where the rear wall of the stage would  fall if the fresco depiction were to match the real stage. The rear  stage wall in the fresco seems to show a number of piercings. Except  for the central and two flanking doorways, these are not represented  as physical entities on either of the plans. Contrasting the fresco  with other frescos, it is noted that the colours are somewhat muted  against the vibrancy of the physical structures, suggesting that this  is a receding view or that it is somewhat 'unreal' (e.g. aerial perspective  or painted panels). </p>
<p>The positioning  of scenic elements appears to become more perspectivally warped the  further vertically or horizontally removed they are from the centre  of the structure, as if the image were painted on a convex surface,  bulging towards the viewer in the centre. The columns themselves do  not lean, but the decorations behind them do, indicating that the  columns have been very deliberately 'corrected' by the Roman artists  to produce a perspectivally coherent framework through which a perspectivally  distorted world can be glimpsed. The effect becomes more pronounced  the further into the scene one looks.</p>
<p>The viewer of  the fresco is therefore presented with varying degrees of reality  that recede into the depiction and away from the viewer. If we were  to map these 'zones' of reality onto the fresco by colour coding,  they could be presented as follows:</p>
<p><a href="images/baker/bakerfig03.jpg"><img src="images/baker/bakerfig03tn.jpg" width="125" height="94"><br>
 </a><b>Fig. 3</b> Identified 'zones of reality'</p>
<p>Green Zone: This  area of the fresco has very close correlation to both the physical  remains of the Great Theatre and to Vitruvius' formulae for theatre  construction.</p>
<p>Yellow Zone: This  area appears to be exaggerated in the vertical axis if the elements  are to follow Vitruvian ideals and human scaling.</p>
<p>Red Zone: While  the elements in each of the red sections (demarcated by the yellow  columns) are in proportion to each other, all of the red sections  together do not constitute a proportionally or structurally unified  area. </p>
<p>Blue Zone: These  areas show elements, or panel-paintings of depicting elements, that  extend beyond the rear wall of the stage building. </p>
<p>Purple Zone: Human  depictions.</p>
<p>This manipulation  of scale, which will have been more immediately apparent to a Roman  viewer familiar with the scale of the real-world correlatives of the  painted elements, signals the painting's refusal to be bound by the  laws of mimetic representation. Rather than paint what the eye sees,  the artist displays what the mind's eye imagines, foregrounding what  is most important, not necessarily what is most visible. It is worth  noting in this regard that the human figures are the only elements  which are not integrated in perspective or scale with any other zone  within the composition. </p>
<p>The recession  of these zones ever further into the fantastical is analogous to the  levels of reality and fantasy encountered upon actual scaenarum frontes  during theatrical performances: behind the <em>frons scaenae</em> are the most  wild, fantastical materials out of which myths come bodied forth into  the reality of the audience.</p>
<h4><em>Perspectival  Analysis of Red Zone</em></h4>
<p> The Red Zone  is made up of a number of compartments distributed across the width  of the painting, separated by Yellow Zone columns. Each of the two  well-preserved Red Zone compartments is perspectivally consistent  within itself, but not with its neighbour, nor with the perspective  of other Zones. </p>
<p>Perspectival inconsistency  between compartments allows the painter incrementally to squash and  stretch the non-rectangular subject matter into the rectangular 'frame'  provided by the wall, while concealing the distortions from the viewer,  thereby giving the impression of a 'realistic' structure, by ensuring  that each local section is perspectivally consistent. In each case,  the perspective leads the viewer deeper into the composition, before  the view is blocked by architectural elements in the next Zone. </p>
<h4><em>Comparing  the Reconstructions</em></h4>
<p> The following  images compare our visualisation of the structure depicted in the  fresco at the Terme del Sarno with a 3D reconstruction of the <em>frons scaenae</em> of the Great Theatre at Pompeii based on the archaeological  evidence and the formulae given by Vitruvius in De Architectura. (Note,  the colours used in the <em>frons scaenae</em> visualisation are purely schematic,  enabling the different components of the structure more clearly to  be distinguished than a photo-realistic model would allow.)</p>

<p>If both of the  structures are placed side by side, as shown in Figure 5, it is possible  to identify the commonalities between them. </p>

<p>While clearly  not a perfect match, it is clear that there are marked similarities  between both structures, and when the lower part of the theatre is  removed and the fresco structure inserted (as shown in Figure 6) the  result is not aesthetically incoherent. The most noticeable difference  is the position of the fresco columns which are not only too tall  as has been noted, but also do not align directly with the upper tier  of the stage itself. </p>

<h4><em>Conclusion</em></h4>
<p> This investigation  of possible correlations between the Terme del Sarno fresco and the  stage of the Great Theatre at Pompeii contributes to our understanding  of some of the complex perspectival distortions that Roman artists  used when evoking architectural, and specifically theatrical, structures.  While it can not be conclusively said that the structure depicted  at the Terme del Sarno depicts the <em>frons scaenae</em> of the Great Theatre,  it is fair to say that there are several elements in the fresco that  bear a strong resemblance to the architecture of this particular Theatre,  which, for Roman viewers, may have suggested a direct relationship  between the two. It may be that, in doing so, the fresco drew upon  common aesthetic principles according to which theatres were being  built in the first century A.D. For the fresco's viewers the Great  Theatre at Pompeii would have provided the most immediate and natural  point of reference for a 'theatrical' composition, which appears to  invite the Roman viewer to associate victors in athletic contests  with the heroic mythological figures that appeared on the stage in  the great public theatres. </p>
