  <h2>FEATURES: EMBODYING ANCIENT THEATER</h2>
  <H2>Animating Ancient Theater Through Computer Graphics</H2>

 <br>
 [Didak]<br>
 The above idea gave us the idea to extend the basic features list of<br>
 the toolkit to include more features dedicated to 'overall view'. Meaning<br>
 that you can move around stage props, parts, etc.<br>
 <br>

 <br>
 [Didak]<br>
 One of most important uses of computer graphics is of course the<br>
 simulation and visualization of subjects that can't be tested under<br>
 normal circumstances due to (as you already stated) lack of funding.<br>
 There are numerous cases in our field where computer graphics have<br>
 convinced prospective investors to make funds available for<br>
 projects. The simulations done (for offshore companies mainly)<br>
 showed new ideas for construction vessels in both global and high<br>
 detail. The designs we made then were exported to another file format<br>
 and processed by another company which specialized in structural analysis.<br>
 This company then tested the stress factors on the design and<br>
 construction to see if it was a safe design (by standards set for<br>
 that industry) and if it was viable from a builders viewpoint.<br>
 I could see the same thing happening for reconstructing ancient<br>
 theater.<br>
 <br>
 [Goetsch]<br>
 >'High-quality professional 3D animations with support for file<br>
 >exchange with systems like AutoCAD' could change all that. <br>
 <br>
 [Didak]<br>
 True. And the AutoCAD format is one of the best-supported industry<br>
 standards for file exchange when it comes to 2D and 3D models.<br>
 <br>
 [Goetsch]<br>
 >We could input the (hypothetical) dimensions of the TDA and create a<br>
 >three-dimensional model which we could rotate to show the actors'<br>
 >and audience's perspectives and test the sight-lines of different<br>
 >positions in the *cavea*. We could re-create the original logistics <br>
 >of choral performance.<br>
 <br>
 [Didak]<br>
 This is one of the features we will not be implementing in the<br>
 toolkit since the packages such as AutoCAD and 3D Studio already<br>
 have provisions for them.<br>
 <br>
 [Goetsch]<br>
 > If the Toolkit incorporates sound,<br>
 >we could synthesize *aulos*-music and its interaction with the<br>
 >acoustic properties of the space.<br>
 <br>
 [Didak]<br>
 There is no way we could add sound to the toolkit. It is possible from<br>
 a technical standpoint, but would make it so much more complex. The<br>
 toolkit will work under 3D Studio which has no direct support for<br>
 audio. It would however be possible to add sound in the post-production<br>
 phase when simulations are stored on video tape. Also the audio aspects<br>
 of theater (ancient or modern) are enormous when taking into account the<br>
 acoustics of settings. This is a completely different matter where<br>
 people are still actively doing research when it comes to computer-<br>
 generated simulation of audio settings.<br>
 <br>
 [Goetsch]<br>
 >In short, software of this sort would allow all of us to work with<br>
 >and in the Theater of Dionysus, or the Theater of Epidavros, or the<br>
 >Theater of Thoricus, or indeed any theater which has been excavated<br>
 >and published, without risking damage to the sites or incurring<br>
 >enormous expenses for building materials and personnel.<br>
 <br>
 [Didak]<br>
 You're absolutely right. Any scene or location can be visualized as<br>
 long as data is available on the design and construction of those<br>
 scenes and locations. The only time invested would be the time to<br>
 create the models (scene, props, etc.) and once that is done it is<br>
 possible to navigate through it easily and efficiently, adding<br>
 lightsources and shadows wherever they are required. If new information<br>
 is found on a specific theater it would mean building the models and<br>
 adding the data to the scene. It would also mean that a lot of<br>
 reconstructions can be made of one particular theater or even to<br>
 reconstruct any theater that has enough published information to<br>
 work with. This will give you the oppurtunity to visualize anything<br>
 you would like to without having to go through the process of<br>
 raising funds for each and every project for materials, etc. A one-<br>
 time investment in computer hardware and software would do the job.<br>
 <br>
 [Goetsch]<br>
 >The ability to animate and to digitally record productions means escape<br>
 >from the confines of slides, which, while better than no illustration<br>
 >of such an intensely visual art, reduce theater to a set of static images<br>
 >and deprive it of its vitality.<br>
 <br>
 [Didak]<br>
 A picture already says more than a thousand words, but just imagine those<br>
 images being animated. Now that will surely keep people glued to the<br>
 displaying device, keep them interested, and will even convince<br>
 prospective investors to fund projects.<br>
 <br>
 I can imagine that after reading our discussion, people might have<br>
 questions about what it takes to create those animations and simulations<br>
 and what possibilities there are at this point in time to get started<br>
 with these tasks and even more important what the costs would be that<br>
 are involved in setting up a system like that.<br>
 <br>
 If we stay focused on the PC platform primarily, there are a number of <br>
 choices that one can make for software. A single copy of Autodesk's<br>
 3D Studio and a 486/66 PC with 16MB of RAM would be a good start at<br>
 about $3500-$4000. In the case of a complete production system there<br>
 are a number of issues involved that have to be addressed. These are<br>
 the video standard to be used (ie. VHS, sVHS, or professional broadcast<br>
 quality like Betacam-sp) or if there is to be recorded and played back<br>
 digitally from disk (like DSP's PAR). A system with sVHS recording<br>
 capabilities like that would be somewhere in the neighborhood of about<br>
 US$6000-$10,000 depending on the video hardware. For professional<br>
 broadcast recording and playback anything from US$10,000 and upward is<br>
 possible, again depending on the hardware of choice.<br>
