  <p>CALL FOR PAPERS</p>
  <p>Colloquium on Ideology and Poetic Form: Greek Comedy</p>
  <p>This colloquium understands ideology as that set of representations by which we situate ourselves in relation to the larger social and natural world that surrounds us. Ideology, therefore, is not simply a conspiracy of the ruling class but includes the full range of discourses that can be elaborated both by regimes and by oppositional movements to construct and maintain images of themselves. </p>
  <p> One of the means through which this self-constructive activity took place in antiquity was through the conscious or implicit investment in traditional literary forms. It is through these forms that we propose to investigate the complex ideological workings of the ancient Mediterranean world. The colloquium will examine a specific genre each year.</p>
  <p> The topic for the 1995 meeting will be Greek comedy. We are soliciting papers that study individual authors and their relation (accessory, adversarial, mixed) to the ideological structure of the Athenian state, as well as papers documenting the ideological orientation of comedy or its historical evolution as a whole.</p>
  <p> <strong>The deadline for submissions is FEB. 1, 1995.</strong></p>
  <p> The coordinator for the 1995 colloquium will be Charles Platter. All abstracts will be judged anonymously and be should be sent to </p>

  <p>CALL FOR PARTICIPANTS</p>
  <p>Multi-Partner Project on Greek Drama in Europe</p>
  <p>1-10 April, 1995 </p>
  
  
  <dl> Purpose Partners in the network will collect and develop study material relating to the adaptation and performance of ancient Greek texts in modern Europe, and will analyze the differences in approach to a common cultural heritage. The focus will be on post - l960 productions which are not merely revivals but make a social and/or political comment on contemporary society. The study material will be collected and developed for use in courses throughout the network. <p> Coordinator: S. Wilmer (Dublin)</p>
 <p> Partners to Date: A. Halls (Athens), S. Patsalides  (Thessaloniki), M. Anderson (Kent), E. Fischer-Lichte (Mainz), P.  Koski (Helsinki), G. Lidstone (U. London, Goldsmiths), G. Giesekam  (Glasgow), Freddy Decreus (Ghent) Willmar Sauter (Stockholm)</p>
  </dl>
  
  
  <dl> Methodology <dt>Participating partners will collect documents (reviews,  articles, chapters of books and iconographic material including videos  and slides) relating to important adaptations (post l960) of the plays  of Aeschylus, Sophocles, Euripides and Aristophanes. They will focus  primarily on their own countries and examine the social/political  comment of the adaptations. The material will be presented at a forum  in Athens in May l995 where the participants will consider similarities  and differences in order to draw some comparative conclusions. The  material will then be compiled into a teaching pack and/or textbook  for a course which can be taught throughout the network. Many of the  participating partners have already conducted research or taught courses  in this area and will contribute their own previously collected material.  New methods in performance analysis and historiography which have  been developed by some of the participants will be used to illuminate  the material.</dt>
  </dl>
  <dl> <dt>Outcome <dt>Materials collected and presented in 1995 will be  compiled into a textbook or study pack or CD-ROM will be compiled  to be used with iconographic material (slides and video tapes) for  use as course material throughout the network.  <p><strong>Participants in the 1995 conference will be responsible for their own airfare and accommodations. </strong></p>

  <p>NEW DESIGN PACKAGE PROPOSED</p>
  <p>Animagic, a computer graphics firm (production and development) based in The Netherlands, has added the development of 3D Studio IPAS routines (plug-in routines) to our activities. We are currently in the process of investigating the stagecraft industry with software development in mind. At Animagic we have no expertise available in the field of stage and lighting design, except for some great beta testers that have been quite helpful in providing information about the industry and what stages are involved in production.</p>
  <p> We have come to a point where we have decided to develop a special toolkit (a suite of IPAS plug-in modules) for Autodesk's 3D Studio Release 3 (and 4). This 'stage and lighting designers' toolkit' will allow people in the industry to efficiently use three-dimensional computer graphics and animation for stage production, presentation, etc. We have found that a lot of companies in the industry are using computer graphics, CAD, and various presentation techniques that are computer-based. The companies that are using computers state that the software used does not integrate with their daily activities, and the companies that are not using computers state as their main reason that there is no real software of the kind they would like to see available.</p>
  <p> We have decided to end this once and for all (at least we hope, let's not get carried away :-).</p>
  <p> To present to you the basic idea of features planned for the software, take a look at this:</p>
   
  <dl> <dd>  <ul>
   <li>Support for animating stage props and elements.  <li>Support for animating (positioning, aiming) hundreds  of lightsources in a friendly and efficient way not provided by  3D Studio. <li>Support for creating color-fading and cross-fading  color washes of lightsources. <li>Support for automatically generating the 3D geometry  for lightsources, lighting rigs, etc. from a 2D map designed as  the basic layout. <li>Support for automatically generating electronics  connection circuits directly from the stage data and models created  in the software. <li>Support for generating animations of productions  and ideas either by recording in full broadcast quality, or by  256 color animations played from the computer system, for communications  with clients by using visual feedback. <li>Support for all industry standard lightsource  types (parabolic arches, spotlights, etc).  </ul>
 <dt> </dt>
 <dd>Not sure (yet):</dd>
  </dl>
  <dl> <dd>  <ul>
   <li>Support for pyrotechnics (explosions, fire, smoke).  <li>Support for laser projection systems.  </ul>
 <dt> </dt>
 <dd>What will (can) not be supported:</dd>
  </dl>
  <dl> <dd>  <ul>
   <li>100% exact lighting simulation  </ul>

  <p>SUMMER THEATRE WORKSHOP</p>
  <p>The Hydra Workshop of Ancient Greek TheatreIn the summer of 1995 the Hydra Workshop of Ancient Greek Theatre, in collaboration with Georgia Southwestern College, will offer a unique theatre workshop, lasting six weeks, on the Greek island of Hydra. The island, an artist's colony where cars are prohibited, is two hours away from the summer theatre festivals of Epidavros and Athens.</p>
  <p>The program will consist of two parallel comprehensive courses: one in the origins, development, and historical background of ancient Greek Drama; and one on practical theatre, involving acting and method group work along with mask-making and movement. In addition, Friday seminars on 'Ancient Greek Theatre in Modern Dress' and a series of lectures from European and American professors will be offered.</p>
  <p> The Workshop starts on July 3rd and ends August 12th 1995. The program is fully accredited: complete instruction for 12 credit hours (or 8 semester hours). The Workshop's language is English.</p>
  <p>The climax of the whole program will be a small-scale production of an ancient play involving all students in either acting or technical roles.</p>
  <p>EC students are eligible for grants from the European Commission to cover tuition, and outstanding or particularly deserving students will receive further help with airfare and full-board accomodation.</p>
