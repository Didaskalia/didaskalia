<h2>Ancient Drama in Performance </h2>
  <p><b>by Pat Easterling</b><br>
 Emerita Regius Professor of Greek <br>

  <P>I want to start at the modern 
 end, with two very recent books which in their different ways deal with modern 
 performance of ancient drama. These are Rush Rehm's <I>Radical Theatre</I> (London 
 2003) and <I>Dionysus since '69</I>, edited by Edith Hall, Fiona Macintosh and 
 Amanda Wrigley (Oxford 2004). Between them they illustrate very tellingly the 
 vast scope and extraordinary rate of growth of this area of research. Thirty-eight 
 pages in <I>Dionysus since '69 </I>are devoted to the details of productions 
 from 1969 onwards (and these are by no means all the productions that have taken 
 place, of course, just the ones discussed in the volume), demonstrating how 
 much has been happening, and how fast the raw material waiting to be studied 
 is accumulating. The remarkable thing about this phenomenon is not the modern 
 staging of ancient drama, especially Greek tragedy, as such, but the fact that 
 it is happening globally and with serious box-office prospects. The challenge 
 for everyone with an interest in ancient drama is to get used to the notion 
 that an art form which until recently has been the preserve, more or less, of 
 elites is becoming a popular medium, with all the implications of such a transformation, 
 and to try to work out a methodology for approaching it.</P>
  <P>Both these books help in important ways. From Edith Hall's Introduction to <I>Dionysus since '69</I>, which situates the Greek drama explosion of the past 35 years in a context of profound social change, it becomes clear that the fascinating question 'Why?' is one that can only be answered provisionally. But Hall's analysis of the interesting ways in which the essays in this collection relate to one another shows how many factors we have to take into account. These include: the impact of the feminist movement and changing attitudes to sexuality and the family; the ever more complex and threatening political problems of the post-colonial world; the 'performative turn' in theatre, the rediscovery of ritual and non-Western performance traditions, the interconnections of theatre, film and television; and finally the whole range of critical trends associated with postmodernism, which have given 'Greek tragedy...an inherent appeal to our psychological and intellectual subjectivity.' (p.42) There is a huge field to be explored, and the challenge is to find a systematic way of discussing and evaluating the findings of explorers. </P>
<P>Rush Rehm suggests one direction 
 in which the discussion can be taken. His main question, in effect, is 
 'What are the problems of modern society that Greek tragedy can help us to face?', 
 and believing as he does that live theatre can and should have a serious political 
 and social role, he explores the possibility (even more difficult) of 'engaging 
 the original form of ancient tragedy ... rather than altering the material to 
 fit contemporary tastes.' (p.17) What Rehm means by 'original form' is 'the 
 structuring principles through which each play delivers its "deep content" ', 
 and what he is resisting is the slick, sentimental or reductive treatment of 
 the plays in productions and adaptations designed to 'go down easy' and evade 
 or trivialise the issues that were central to the originals. He has some 
 equally robust criticism of the more imperialistic claims of performance theory 
 and what he sees as its refusal to engage with lived experience. This 
 is how he puts his sense of the way tragedy functions: 'Requiring moment-to-moment 
 realization in a <I>mimesis</I> not co-extensive with reality, Greek tragedy 
 reminds us that humans live real lives (the only ones we have) and die real 
 deaths, however hard we try to deny it.' (p.20) </P>
 <P>The issues raised by 
 these books certainly need to be addressed and will provoke plenty of 
 discussion, but in this short note I want to look at the idea of the 
 discipline more generally, asking what it means nowadays to do research on 
 the performance of ancient drama.</P>
 <P><STRONG>Starting from 
 Now</STRONG><br>The study of modern 
 performance has been growing very fast, trying to keep up with, and make 
 sense of, what has been happening in the theatre. It has been 
 stimulated by the fact that reception history had already been 
 establishing itself as a discipline, with work in Germany, Greece and 
 Italy helping to pave the way. </P>
 
<P>In the UK the last decade 
 has been crucial for building up resources and laying the foundations for future 
 research on the performance and reception of particular plays. The Archive 
 of Performances of Greek and Roman Drama at Oxford, and the Open University's 
 research project on the Reception of Greek Texts and Images in Late Twentieth 
 century Drama and Poetry in English, have both been influential (many of the 
 essays in <I>Dionysus since '69</I>, for example, began life as lectures sponsored 
 by the Archive). A new Centre for Ancient Drama and its Reception has 
 been established at Nottingham; there was a session on 12 March in the colloquium 
 'Studying the Ancient Greek Theatre', co-organised by the Hellenic Society and 
 the Institute of Classical Studies, at which each of these projects was presented 
 and discussed.</P>
 
<P>Electronic communication has 
 made all this data-gathering easier and at the same time more ambitious: archive 
 material has to be incorporated in searchable databases, and on-line seminars 
 like the one run by the OU, or journals like <I>Didaskalia</I>, are designed 
 to keep researchers in touch with events, developments and issues as they 
 come up around the world. The extraordinary expansion of interest in Greek drama 
 throughout and far beyond its traditional European and European-influenced centres 
 makes an active international network all the more crucial. One example 
 is the European Network of Research and Documentation of Ancient Greek Drama 
 performances, set up by Platon Mavromoustakos and Oliver Taplin in 1995. Others 
 will surely follow, and a great deal of work has already been done on the gathering 
 of American archive material. </P>
 
 <p><strong>Working out a methodology</strong><br>
 There have been interesting 
 conferences in this country and abroad, good contexts for scholars and theatre 
 practitioners to compare working methods and critical assumptions, but we shouldn't 
 be surprised if it takes time to build up a sense of a fairly coherent hermeneutic 
 tradition. My own impression, from attending e.g. 'Theatre Ancient and 
 Modern' at Milton Keynes in 2000, the <I>Tantalus</I> day at King's College 
 London, '<I>Agamemnon</I>' at Oxford in 2001, and 'Greek Drama III' at Sydney 
 in 2002, is that such events can be genuinely liberating for traditionally trained 
 scholars. But each time I have also had the feeling that there is still much 
 to be done before we can systematically debate fundamental issues like the status 
 of the 'original' text in modern performance, or refine our definition of the 
 guiding principles of reception studies.</P>
 
<P>From my own point of view, 
 as a student of Greek tragedy and the history of texts, these new experiences 
 have stimulated what I hope is a more joined-up way of thinking about the reception 
 process than the one I used to have. If we think of the process starting as 
 soon as a play was first put on in antiquity and continuing until now, everything 
 that seems to be related to it (admittedly not always easy to identify) is then 
 potentially relevant to our understanding of the play's capacity to have meaning 
 for different audiences and cultures. Some productions, like some critical 
 interpretations or some translations, will be trivialising or perverse, and 
 will turn out over time to make very little difference; but nothing is ruled 
 out in principle, and all can be seen as 'readings' of sorts. The more 
 conscious we are of the way canons get formed (and continually re-formed) the 
 more use we can make of the 'serviceability' test: does a particular work, or 
 way of approaching it, have the power to go on being useful in some way or other 
 to new readers/audiences? And if it does, what makes it so serviceable? 
 (If it doesn't, it will get filtered out soon enough.) This is why I find it 
 exciting that the study of reception in antiquity is becoming less isolated, 
 and the idea of a continuous process becoming more familiar and acceptable. 
 Even in Byzantine times, after all, when the theatre had been abolished, some 
 Greek tragedies were regularly studied in schools, and texts were regularly 
 re-copied, giving them more chance of surviving to be revived on stage when 
 the time came.</P>
 <p><strong>Starting from 
 Antiquity</strong><br>
 The linking of ancient and modern reception has important implications, too, for another aspect of the discipline: the study of all aspects of the culture of antiquity that might throw light on performance, particularly material culture, from theatre design to vase-paintings, mosaics, frescos and even graffiti. Research in this field has a long history &#151; Pickard-Cambridge and Webster are still influential presences in the literature, and their work has shaped much of what has followed &#151; but it has certainly benefited from the impact of the 'performative turn' and from the development of electronic resources. The publications of the Ancient Theatre Project at the Institute of Classical Studies, and Richard Beacham's work at Warwick on <a href="../vol5no1/beacham/postlude.html">Virtual Reality reconstructions</a> of ancient theatre structures, are two important examples; Richard Green's bibliographical survey<I> </I>articles on Theatre Production&#151;<I>Lustrum</I> 31 (1989), 37 (1998) with a new one coming out soon&#151;demonstrate how fast the subject has been moving.</P>
  <P class=MsoBodyText>The last decade has been remarkably productive: Green's <I>Theatre in Ancient Greek Society</I> (London 1994), Eric Csapo and William J. Slater <I>The Context of Ancient Drama </I>(Ann Arbor 1995) and Jean-Charles Moretti <I>Th&eacute;&#0226;tre et soci&eacute;t&eacute; dans la Gr&#0232;ce antique</I> (Paris 2001) have helped us to think about performance in the larger context of society and culture, and the more society-focused interest is seen, too, in the work of Charlotte Rouech&eacute; on Aphrodisias, Brigitte le Guen on the <I>Dionusou technitai</I>, Peter Wilson on <I>choregia</I> and many others. When Edith Hall and I were editing <I>Greek and Roman Actors</I> (Cambridge 2002), it was very clear to us that developments both in the study of antiquity and in more recent reception history had made classical scholars better disposed to the idea that 'late' did not necessarily mean 'decadent', and that performance traditions like pantomime (which have no textual tradition) might even have something to tell us about tragedy. </P>
  <P class=MsoBodyText>The subject has gained strength, too, from the work of scholars who write on ancient theatre from the vantage point of their professional involvement in contemporary drama studies and who themselves direct plays: here I am thinking of recent books by David Wiles (<I>Tragedy in Athens</I> and <I>Greek Theatre Performance,</I> Cambridge 1997 and 2000), and Rush Rehm (<I>The Play of Space</I>, Princeton 2002).</P>

 <P><strong>Forging the 
 links</strong><br>
	 Of course 
 not everyone will be interested in starting in the fifth century BC and working 
 forward through the centuries, and most directors and audiences are more likely 
 to want to make a direct leap between now and that distant past. Erika 
 Fischer-Lichte (<I>Dionysus Since '69</I>, p.351) quotes Peter Stein's bold 
 claim: 'Through the text that is handed down and in a rather adventurous way, 
 [the actor] is able to make contact directly with something which happened 2,500 
 years ago.' At the same time, as Fischer-Lichte goes on to point out, 
 Stein's production of <I>Oresteia</I> was designed to suggest that 'whatever 
 we think we know about the past is a kind of re-invention &#151; a construction, 
 a fantasy.'</P>
 
<P class=MsoBodyText>This is 
 where the translator has a specially delicate and responsible role, and one 
 of the best outcomes of the Greek drama explosion has been the great upsurge 
 in new translations, some of them directly associated with productions or based 
 on workshops and experiment. The Everyman translations of Sophocles (1999, 
 2000) were worked out on the basis of productions directed by the translators, 
 Michael Ewans, Graham Ley and Gregory McCart, and their notes include detailed 
 discussion of how they realised the texts in performance. The series edited 
 for Methuen by Michael Walton, and Peter Meineck's translations for Hackett, 
 are informed by the same professional awareness of how theatre works - see David 
 Wiles (2000, pp.196-208, 236) for a discussion of some of the issues.</P>
  <P class=MsoBodyText>Translators who are also creative writers&#151;Tony Harrison, Timberlake Wertenbaker, Seamus Heaney&#151;have the power to give the modern performance of ancient plays a special appeal for contemporary audiences, contributing to the perception that this medium is no longer one that belongs to the narrow world of the academy. As academics we ought to be delighted by what seems to be a move into the mainstream, even though it makes our job a great deal harder: the boundaries we try to draw round our subject are constantly being challenged and extended, and this can only be good for us in the long run.</P>
