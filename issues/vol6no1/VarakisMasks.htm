  <h2>Research on the Ancient Mask</h2>
  <div class=Section1> <p>by Angie Varakis<br>
  Royal Holloway</p>
 <p align="left" >The  classical 'helmet' mask as depicted by the archaeological evidence  is considered by classicists as one of the defining conventions of  Greek theatre. In recent years there has been a growing understanding  by academics and theatre practitioners that in ancient times the Greek  mask was more than a functional device with practical applications.  It was also strongly connected to the quality of the texts and the  deeply formalistic nature of ancient theatre. This in combination  to the limitations a realistic approach to ancient drama could pose  for theatre practitioners has led to an increasing development in  mask research and a growing interest in exploring the potential of  re-introducing the mask in the modern staging of ancient Greek drama.  </p>
 <p>In  the world of academia a great deal of research in ancient mask iconography  has been undertaken in recent times by T.B.L. Webster and J. R. Green  as part of 'the ancient theatre project' centred on the Institute  of Classical Studies in London. This work involved building up a data-base  of masks. Webster's catalogues of masks<a href="#_edn1" name="_ednref1"
title="">[1]</a> are historically valuable as they give an indication of the ancient  theatrical masks' appearance and popularity by period and area. However  they do not explore the mask's significance within performance practice.  Research in this area has just begun to develop with the work of academics  from the field of theatre studies and classics such as David Wiles,  Michael Walton, Nurit Yaari, Martha Johnson, C.W. Marshall and Claude  Calame which aims to show how masks can develop and shape our understanding  of Greek theatre and society.<a href="#_edn2" name="_ednref2" title="">[2]</a>  Also there is a developing theoretical research in ancient masks from  an anthropological point of view by French academics such as Frontisi-Ducroux  and Jean-Pierre Vernant.<a href="#_edn3" name="_ednref3"
title="">[3]</a> The work of the latter, attempts to connect images of Satyrs  and the Gorgon as depicted by the archaeological evidence to theatre  masks of the earliest tragedies. </p>
 <p>Parallel  to academic research, a number of professional theatre practitioners  have tried to explore the potential of masks in performance by using  them in their stagings of Greek drama. The monumental masked productions  of Tyrone Guthrie (<i>Oedipus</i> (1955)) and Jean Louis Barrault  (<i>Oresteia</i> (1955)) as well as a series of productions by Karolos  Koun in Greece and Peter Hall in Britain have generated public awareness  of the Greek mask tradition and have given the incentive to the project  of appreciating how Greek texts work when presented in masks. For  Karolos Koun, the mask was considered an alienating as much as a ritualistic  device which made the tragic characters seem greater with a clear  and lasting signification whilst in the case of Aristophanic comedy  helped create a festive atmosphere similar to that found in Greek  carnival events and folk celebrations.<a href="#_edn4" name="_ednref4"
title="">[4]</a> As Koun argued when discussing this issue, masks should be used  on the characters in performance 'to help maintain their scale and  impersonal nature'.<a href="#_edn5" name="_ednref5" title="">[5]</a>  For Peter Hall, the mask was connected to the formalistic nature of  ancient theatre and the simplicity of the classical artistic expression  and its use within his productions aimed to highlight the stylised  nature of ancient performance practice.<a href="#_edn6"
name="_ednref6" title="">[6]</a> </p>
 <p>The  masked work of the aforementioned professional practitioners, have  created few imitators and therefore for practical experimentation  with Greek masks one should look elsewhere. In recent years the majority  of practical research on masks has been undertaken by academics in  collaboration with independent artists who are drawn to ancient theatre  practice and professional or semi-professional small-scale companies  that are interested in masked theatre such as the 'Mask Studio' with  director Michael Chase which is based in England and 'The Scottish  Mask and Puppet Centre' with director Malcolm Knight based in Glasgow.<a href="#_edn7" name="_ednref7" title="">[7]</a>  </p>
 <p>Richard  William's 'New Comedy masks Project' based at the University of Glasgow  in collaboration with 'The Scottish Mask and Puppet Centre' has taken  Webster's New Comedy research on masks a step further due to the development  in IT technology that enables the researcher through 3D scanning to  use the information provided by the archaeological evidence as a valuable  source for the reconstruction of New Comedy masks which are then used  in live performance. Just like Webster's work, this research deals  with artefacts. However it exclusively explores three-dimensional  objects, such as miniature ancient theatre masks, which through 3D  scanning are enlarged to life size. This project has initiated practice-based  research 'leading to live performances that are the first to use objectively  reconstructed ancient masks'.<a href="#_edn8" name="_ednref8" title="">[8]</a>  By asking actors to work with costumes and masks based on a close  analysis of the artefacts one can appreciate the possibilities of  the ancient masks in performance practice and further an understanding  of how performers moved and acted in antiquity. The structure of the  mask could be a very valuable source of information when exploring  the bodily movement of the performer because its form could guide  the actor's movement. As Lecoq observes when discussing this issue  '...we can allow ourselves to be guided by the form itself, as it is  shaped by the structure of the mask. The mask then becomes a sort  of vehicle, drawing the whole body into an expressive use of space,  determining the particular movements which make the character appear.'<a
href="#_edn9" name="_ednref9" title="">[9]</a></p>
 <p>The  helmet mask if compared to the more popular half mask of the <i>commedia  dell'Arte </i>tradition is very different in terms of shape and style.  The Greek mask covered the face and top of the performer's head. Actors  wearing such masks not only had their vision restricted but also had  their mouth covered. This means that most researchers interested in  exploring the Greek mask have to pose and answer a number of questions  that do not apply for half masks. One of these is the alteration and  projection of the performer's voice when speaking in them. </p>
 <p>The  recent work of the mask-maker Thanos Vovolis in Athens has been particularly  important in demonstrating to mask-makers as well as performers how  the mask can serve as a form of musical instrument by enhancing and  altering the quality of the voice. His experiments allow us to understand  the essence of the mask in ancient theatre and its great potential  when using it in modern performance. In terms of the relation between  the mask and the actor, Vovolis' argues that the mask helps the performer's  body function as a unity which enables him to increase the volume  of his voice. <a href="#_edn10" name="_ednref10" title="">[10]</a>  Vovolis' appreciation of the mask as a musical instrument has inspired  the work of Michael Chase in Britain. Recent experiments with Michael  Chase's Greek masks have mainly focused on the acoustics and visibility  of the mask when presented in indoor venues and outdoor natural environments  exploring how far the actors could combine clear articulation with  enhanced resonance. The research has also considered other issues  such as training and what forms of preparation can prepare the actor  to make best use of the helmet mask. The project has been documented  and its findings published in a recent article by David Wiles and  mask-maker Chris Vervain. <a
href="#_edn11" name="_ednref11" title="">[11]</a></p>
 <p>The  extensive research of professor Greg McCart based at the University  of Southern Queensland in Australia has also explored a number of  issues regarding the use of the Greek mask in modern performance practice.  His masked projects (The Theatre of Dionysos research project, 1993-94,  The <i>Oedipus the King</i> project, 1995-96, The <i>Medea</i> Project,  1997, The<i> Thesmophoriazousai</i> Project, 1997 and the <i>Bakchai</i>  project, 1999-2000) have all tested the effects of using masks in  the staging of Greek drama in relation to the performer's acting technique  and the spectator's perception of the mask in various spaces. The  masks used in his experiments are designed based on the illustrations  of ancient vases and function as a cover for the face and top of the  performer's head. Greg McCart has also tested the acoustics of ancient  theatres using masked performers during a series of fieldtrips to  Greece and Cyprus and has argued that the acoustic center existed  principally for the benefit of the masked actor. His work has been  well documented and video clips of his projects are easily accessible  and available to view at the 'Playing with Tragedy' web-site that  contains Greg McCart's records of theatrical experiments with ancient  Greek drama from 1985 to 2000. <a
href="#_edn12" name="_ednref12" title="">[12]</a> </p>
 <p>Apart  from the developing research on the Greek mask, academics such as  C.W Marshall in Canada have also shown an increasing interest in exploring  the use of mask in Roman theatre. Part of Marshall's research on the  comedies of Plautus is to explore the way in which actors performed.  Using as a guide the shape of the Roman mask as depicted by the archaeological  evidence he attempts to reconstruct the ancient actor's acting technique  and physical movement. His findings suggest that the mask was used  in a very similar way to that of the later tradition of the Italian  <i>Commedia dell' Arte</i>. Since 1995 C.W. Marshall has been directing,  producing and translating classical works under the title 'Modern  Actors Staging Classics' based in Vancouver in which the mask has  played a central role.</p>
 <p class=MsoBodyText>Finally,  the recent Greek Theatre Mask conference organised by the Department  of Drama and Theatre, Royal Holloway University of London, in association  with the Institute for Art History, University of Glasgow in 2002  brought together all those who have been actively engaged in designing  and performing in Greek masks as well as academics interested in the  specific topic, in order to understand what has been learned by their  so far research. By bringing academics and theatre practitioners in  touch, the conference produced a fruitful exchange of knowledge regarding  the historical function and modern potential of the Greek mask. It  also revealed the increasing development and interest in exploring  the Greek mask in recent times. The conference focused on the particular  acoustical and visual qualities of the Greek helmet mask whilst highlighting  its great potential when used correctly in the modern revival of ancient  drama. The resonating qualities of the helmet mask were underlined  through a keynote lecture by Thanos Vovolis and a presentation of  findings based on a week of AHRB-funded experimentation with the masks  of Thanos Vovolis and Michael Chase. All conference participants  agreed that the acoustic and visual benefits of such masks are a matter  of great interest which need further investigation in order to function  successfully in performance practice. The major points of the conference  have been gathered and can be found in a published conference report  by Margaret Coldiron under the title 'Masks in the Ancient and Modern  Theatre.<a href="#_edn13" name="_ednref13" title="">[13]</a> </p>
 <p>The  aforementioned efforts to explore the effects of the mask within the  modern staging of ancient drama are most important in forming our  understanding of ancient performance. By examining and trying out  one of the defining conventions of ancient theatre one can best appreciate  the nature of the Greek theatrical experience. Moreover a deep understanding  of ancient performance could generate new possibilities for the future.  Every theatrical period and culture inhabits a unique world of conventions  and it is often through exposure to conventions of other ages and  places that change is effected and new traditions invented. The insistence  of our culture on facial acting is a peculiarity of the modern world  that has led to the abandonment of masks. The value of the growing  development of mask research in recent times lies in the fact that  it does not only generate a growing awareness of the Greek mask tradition  but could also help the mask convention to regain its popularity and  central position within the performative experience opening room for  new creative possibilities within the staging of ancient drama. </p>
