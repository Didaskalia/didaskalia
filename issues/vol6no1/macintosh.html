  <div class=Section1> <h2>Current and Future Developments  in the Performance Reception of Ancient Drama</h2>

 <p>I have been asked  by the editors to offer some thoughts towards a discussion about current  and future developments in the performance reception of ancient drama.  Since I joined the Archive of Performances of Greek and Roman Drama  at the University of Oxford in January 2000, I have been involved  in various publications, which have highlighted the need for further  research in particular areas. </p>
 <p>When I set about  writing the diachronic introductory overview of the reception of Euripides'  <i>Medea</i> for the first Archive volume, <i>Medea in Performance:  1500-2000</i> (Legenda, 2000), it became increasingly evident that  the start date of the volume was not only arbitrary, it was also highly  restrictive. It was not simply that the term 'Renaissance' had recently  come under increasing scrutiny from wide quarters &#151; ignoring as it  does the uninterrupted tradition of 'classical learning' that was  sustained in Byzantium and the Arabic and Syriac scholarly traditions,  especially Bagdad. It was also because there was a growing awareness  of the rich performance tradition of <i>Medea</i> in antiquity from  almost immediately following the premi&#0232;re of Euripides' tragedy until  beyond St Augustine, not only in the tragic theatre but in comedy,  mime, dance and sung recital, which cried out to be told within any  such diachronic overview. The pioneering volume, edited by Pat Easterling  and Edith Hall, <i>Greek and Roman Actors</i>: <i>Aspects of an Ancient  Profession</i> (Cambridge 2002), shows how vibrant a tradition this  was, and there is a clear need for those involved in performance reception  in the modern world to be able to draw upon the researches of those  few specialists who are able to piece together that complex early  history from disparate Christian and pagan sources, including visual  records, literary testimonia, papyri, graffiti and other inscriptions.  </p>
 <p>Over many years,  I have found that it is the genuinely interdiscplinary and international  nature of performance reception that makes it so exciting. Working  with Edith Hall on <i>Greek Tragedy and the British Theatre 1660-1914</i>  (OUP January 2005), we were always more than aware of the agonistic  (and often parasitical) relationship between the London and (mostly)  Parisien stages, and between the British re-workings and the continental  operatic versions of the classical plays. And if the early (well-documented)  performance history of opera is inextricably linked to Greek tragedy,  I have recently through writing this book become aware of the extent  to which modern appropriations of the chorus cannot be considered  independently of a serious understanding of the developments in dance  in the modernist period. Indeed, a rigorous and systematic study of  operatic and balletic treatments of the ancient plays needs to be  undertaken to enable us to appreciate the sheer breadth of influence  exerted by Greek drama throughout the entire modern period. Non-verbal  reception in music and movement has not had any refined and thorough-going  treatment, and we need to be aware that ancient information about  the theatre (not just the dramatic texts themselves) - for example  in anecdotes preserved in Plutarch or Philostratus, and treatises  on dance by Lucian and Choricius - has exerted a continual influence  on the Western founding fathers and practitioners of new genres of  musical theatre.</p>
 <p>Finally, as Lorna  Hardwick's illuminating monograph on <i>Reception Studies</i> (OUP  2003) shows, there is much need for a rigorous examination of the  methodology behind performance reception in particular. Much useful  'theory' has been developed in association with Reception Studies  in general, but it has tended to put the reader at the heart of the  process of reception, concentrating on texts that are primarily consumed  by the reader, rather than on those designed for and enjoyed in the  much more accessible and often less elitist context of public entertainment.  Performance reception is a privileged site for thinking about the  interrelations between theatre history, theory and practice. It reaffirms  the importance, and indeed the centrality, of the performance arts  in cultural debates about the relevance of the classical past for  the present. However, since so much work in performance reception  has been conducted in areas where subject specialists (for a whole  host of reasons, which are worth investigating) have rarely ventured  before, there has perhaps been much that has been overly empirical  and raw. Now, perhaps, all of us need to start asking serious questions  about what exactly we are doing when we revisit a performance to assess  its significance at a particular time for a particular audience, and  we need to ask what there is that is unique about the newly emergent  discipline: performance reception of antiquity.</p>
