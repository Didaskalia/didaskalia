 <p align="center"><i>There  is an urgent need for empirical and theoretical research frameworks  to be more closely linked and for <br>
  practice-based research to be better integrated with the work done  by cassicists and theatre historians. </i></p>
 <p>Empirical studies  of modern performances are in themselves very far from problematic.  Not even the most diligent researcher (with access to a magic  carpet) can personally observe and record information about the increasing  numbers of modern productions. A wide variety of productions needs  to be analysed before judgements can be made about trends in selection  of plays, production styles and the broader impact of Greek drama  in modern theatre aesthetics and cultural politics. Therefore, to  accompany its database of examples (published on-line at <A 
 href="http://www2.open.ac.uk/ClassicalStudies/GreekPlays">http://www2.open.ac.uk/ClassicalStudies/GreekPlays</A>), researchers  at the Open University's project on the Reception of Greek Texts and  Images in Late Twentieth century Drama and Poetry in English<b> </b>have  developed a series of short critical essays analysing the subjectivities  and cultural and political bias of key sources, such as theatrical  reviews, and interviews with theatre practitioners. A photo gallery  is being developed to enable a more systematic critique of visual  sources and in the future we hope to develop graphics for representing  and analysing choreography, movement and the use of different theatrical  spaces. There is also a need for fuller information about the financial  and other arrangements that allow productions to take place (who 'gets  a Chorus' and why and how?). More conceptually sophisticated audience  research is also needed in order to inform judgements about the extent  to which spectators relate either the ancient plays or modern adaptations  to contemporary situations and to their own experience.</P>
 <P><B>The Empirical  and the Theoretical</B><br>
  Capturing, recording and interpreting data from modern performance  leads both to a re-examination of the ancient evidence and to investigation  of the contexts through which the plays have migrated and been interpreted  and mediated into modern environments (see <a href="decreus.html">Decreus</a>  in this issue). In assessing the dialogue between ancient and modern,  I see two areas of research as priorities. </P>
 <P>The first is the  relationship between translation and performance (translation for  and into performance). Key problems of interpretation include the  relationship between translation and perceptions of performability.  Performability is a concept that translation researchers such as Susan  Bassnett have rightly problematised, but which remains to be further  explored by classicists and performance researchers, especially with  respect to the relationship between verbal and non-verbal aspects  of performance and the dynamics through which ancient play and modern  spectators are brought together. (I have developed aspects of this  issue in a chapter 'Staging <I>Agamemnon</I>: the languages of translation'  in E Hall, F Macintosh, P Michelakis, O Taplin (eds.) <I>Agamemnon  in Performance</I>: <EM>458 BC - 2002 AD</EM>, Oxford, forthcoming).  Such questions are also valid for performances in the original language, partly  because of the trends towards the use of sur-titles, and partly because  of the ways in which design, setting, gesture and movement assist  the Greekless to interpret the words. There is also a significant  trend towards multi-lingual performances. All these factors suggest  that new kinds of philological research are needed in order to track  the way in which the ancient texts have moved through translations  and performances in different times, places and cultures.</P>
 <P>The second key area  for research is the impact of non-Western theatrical traditions on  modern performances and on how relationships to the ancient theatre  are perceived. For example, it is increasingly suggested that adaptation  for and performance in African theatre has restored awareness of the  importance in Greek theatre of song, dance and vocal and visual colour  &#151; elements that western European performance traditions have either  marginalised or shifted to other genres (opera, burlesque). West-African  writers and directors from Wole Soyinka and Ola Rotimi to Femi Osofisan  and Femi Elufowoju Jr. work across and between classical and African  in both text and performance. Similar arguments can be made in respect  of Caribbean and North African use of classical texts. (I have developed  some preliminary discussion in 'Greek Drama and Anti- Colonialism:  Decolonising Classics' in E. Hall, F. Macintosh and A. Wrigley (eds.)  <I>Dionysus since '69: Greek Tragedy at the Dawn of the Third</I>  <I>Millenium</I>, Oxford, 2004.) This new work has challenged  rigid senses of aesthetic and political security and cultural identity  in Western European, North American and African contexts. Nevertheless,  such work has often been commissioned from Western metropolitan centres  rather than from Africa. Further research (and time) will be needed  before judgements can be made about whether this work marks a new  hybrid phase in the migratory path of Greek drama, perhaps mapping  changes in the exchanging cultures themselves, or whether it is merely  the result of a fascination for the exotic with which Western European  and North American culture is prolonging its appropriation of ancient  drama. </p>
 <p>These issues make the 
 reception of ancient drama a key feature of the investigation of cultural 
 change and indicate its potential contribution to performance theory and 
 to cross-cultural understanding in a world in which boundaries of 
 nationality and cultural identity are increasingly recognised as 
 porous.</p>
