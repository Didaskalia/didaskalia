<h1 id="journal_title"> Developments and Trends in Contemporary Research </h1>
<p class="journal_abstract"><a href="editorial.html">This issue marks the tenth anniversary of Didaskalia, and is the first to be published in association with the Open University. Both the practice and study of ancient drama in performance have been transformed almost beyond recognition since our first issue was published in March 1994, so it seemed like a good time to take stock. We will be publishing three issues this year. Following the current issue, 'Developments and Trends in Contemporary Research', a second issue will survey and assess the several 'Contemporary Electronic Research Initiatives' that have gradually been changing the ways in which we research, teach and learn about ancient drama as theatrical and textual phenomena in antiquity and since. The final issue of 2004 will examine 'Responses to Ancient Drama in Contemporary Performance', asking directors, performers, playwrights, designers, critics, academics, and theatre-goers to contribute their perspectives upon the uses to which ancient drama is, or could be, put in performance today.
