 <p>During the past twenty years, Greek tragedy has become an effective means 
  for commenting on contemporary Irish society north and south. With its archetypal 
  characters and situations that are sufficiently removed in time and place, 
  Greek tragedy has provided subtle (and not so subtle) metaphors for the current 
  political situation. An approach common to several adaptations has been to 
  use the Trojan war as a metaphor for the troubles in Northern Ireland. Tom 
  Paulin's <em>The Riot Act</em>, Brendan Kennelly's <em>The Trojan Women</em>, 
  Seamus Heaney's <em>The Cure at Troy</em> and other adaptations have created 
  strong parallels between the ten-year war in Troy and the ongoing conflict 
  in Northern Ireland. In this paper I want to examine the image of the watchman 
  in the <em>Agamemnon</em> and consider how it has been adapted by Thaddeus O'Sullivan 
  into film, and by Seamus Heaney into poetry.</p>
 <p>The film <em>In the Border Country</em> directed by Thaddeus O'Sullivan 
  in 1991 for Channel 4 television, focusses on internecine killing rather than 
  any hope for peace. The main emphasis is on the theme of revenge that leads 
  to one killing after another within the same family. The Agamemnon figure 
  (played by Sean McGinley) is an IRA man whose family gets drawn into the conflict 
  because of his actions. His wife played by Juliet Stevenson is quite pregnant 
  and pleads for him not to leave her. Against her wishes, he departs for IRA 
  activity and while he is away, she miscarries. Like Clytemnestra, she blames 
  the death of their child on her husband and his war efforts and uses it as 
  an excuse both to take a new lover (a neighbour named McGuire), and to have 
  her husband killed. Her children, a daughter and son (like Electra and Orestes), 
  are horrified by their mother's new relationship and her involvement in her 
  husband's death. Like Electra, the daughter Morna (Electra becomes Morna 
  instead of Mourning Becomes Electra) urges her brother to return to help her 
  kill the neighbour. And the tragedy ends with the brother and sister also 
  killing their mother. Thus O'Sullivan has transformed a Greek trilogy into 
  a television play. However, it is not the trilogy of the <em>Oresteia</em> 
  but the trilogy of <em>Iphigenia at Aulis</em>, <em>Agamemnon</em> and <em>The 
  Libation Bearers</em>. Any positive denouement such as is implied in the <em>Eumenides</em> 
  is avoided and the TV production ends on a note of despair and hopelessness, 
  as Morna tries to understand whether she really meant to kill her mother or 
  not.</p>
 <p>The notion of the watchman in O'Sullivan's film takes on a much more sinister 
  dimension than in Heaney's poetic approach. In <em>In the Border Country,</em> 
  there is no watchman character who utters the speech from the palace roof 
  as in Aeschylus' play, <em>Agamemnon</em>. But in a sense, everyone becomes 
  a watchman or watchwoman. There is little sense of trust. Everyone suspects 
  the actions of everyone else, and watches to see what they will do. Furthermore, 
  by watching, the watcher becomes complicit in the action, either as an accomplice 
  or as a witness. There is no innocent bystanding. If you observe a murder, 
  you are immediately implicated in the action and must decide whether to report 
  it or keep silent, to inform or conform, to support the action or take revenge. 
  Even a little boy becomes involved when he watches his father brutally murdered 
  by Hugh Athey (Agamemnon), and is immediately seen as a threat, a possible 
  informant or avenger.The father wants to protect his innocence when he knows 
  what is about to him. He sends his son away as the IRA hitman (Hugh) approaches, 
  and as Hugh prepares to shoot him, the father yells: "Please wait. Don't 
  shoot. The boy." The father tries to preserve the innocence of the next 
  generation but fails as his son observes his brutal murder, and so the son 
  becomes a likely avenger. Thus, the watchman in<em> In the Border Country 
  </em>is an agent of destruction. Binoculars become a symbol of mistrust, suspicion 
  and malevolence: observing carries the subtext of planning aggressive retaliatory 
  action. Even the innocent bystanding boy, immediately picks up a stone after 
  his father is murdered and hurls it through the windscreen of the murderer's 
  car.</p>
 <p>At the beginning of the film, the "border" of the title <em>In the Border 
  Country</em> is evidenced not only by the border landscape of northern Ireland 
  but also by two neighbouring farms, one owned by an IRA man and the other 
  a Northern Irish Protestant. The two men observe one another from a distance, 
  emphasising the geographical proximity but also the distance in political 
  and religious affiliation. Hugh (the Agamemnon figure) observes his neighbour 
  McGuire (Aegisthus) and teaches his son that it would be a good deed for the 
  country to kill him. Likewise McGuire watches Hugh, waiting for an opportunity 
  to dispose of him.</p>
 <p>Helen and Paris also appear in the film as characters. Smith (Paris) is 
  apparently a secret agent for the British army (another type of watchman). 
  He observes Helen from afar and, on discovering that her husband is away, 
  takes advantage of her. Helen says, "Have you decided to see what I look 
  like close up? Do I know you? You're a spy." </p>
 <p>Helen and Paris have an affair, and he takes 
  her away to a hotel. </p>
 <p>Helen: Where are you taking me?</p>
 <p>Paris: Where do you want to go?</p>
 <p>Helen: Anywhere away from this hole.</p>
 <p>Helen's husband also becomes a watchman, first looking for the departed 
  Helen, and then observing her and her lover from afar. In addition to the 
  principal characters, there is also an unnamed watcher for the IRA, identified 
  as the messenger, who observes and brings news of Helen's defection. Likewise 
  Hugh's daughter and son (the Electra and Orestes characters) become watchers, 
  observing the actions of their mother, their father and the neighbour. By 
  observing, they become progressively more involved in the tragedy, to the 
  extent that they eventually become perpetrators. Far from creating a sense 
  of redemption or, as in the <em>Eumenides</em>, the hope for a new political 
  solution, O'Sullivan's film only shows the sea of violence that gradually 
  drowns everyone. By living on the border, watching each other and becoming 
  involved in the saga of revenge, the characters help to perpetuate the tragedy 
  that separates the two communities of Northern Ireland. </p>
 <p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US>Not only are the principal and peripheral 
  characters watchmen, but also the viewer of the film becomes a kind of watchman 
  whom, it seems, Thaddeus O'Sullivan hopes to implicate in the events. The 
  opening shot is from the outside of Hugh's house towards the open window of 
  his bedroom. As the camera zooms in and moves into the house, the viewer 
  is drawn inside the bedroom and becomes a close observer of the action, becoming 
  aware that Hugh is sleeping next to his gun and his wife is heavily pregnant 
  and in danger of losing her baby. The viewer continues to watch an appalling 
  series of violent acts. Thus, the camera implicates the viewer in the action 
  of the piece and turns him/her into a witness rather than an innocent bystander, 
  witnessing the events in the north, which, although fictional, parallel the 
  facts of life of living on the border. </p>
 <p> By contrast with Thaddeus O'Sullivan's 
  <em>In the Border Country</em>, Seamus Heaney's adaptation of <em>Agamemnon</em> 
  projects a more hopeful stance. Heaney published <em>The Spirit Level</em>, 
  a book of poetry that won the Whitbread award in 1996, in which he included 
  a series of five poems entitled "Mycenae Lookout". In these poems, Heaney 
  takes the position of the watchman on top of Agamemnon's palace as his vantage 
  point, waiting and watching for years for the war to end. The troubles in 
  Northern Ireland that have lasted for half of Heaney's life, resonate in his 
  descriptions of the ten-year war between the Greeks and Trojans, emphasised 
  by anachronistic images of cattle trucks and abattoirs. The first section 
  of "Mycenae Lookout", which he titles "The Watchman's War", begins with the 
  watchman lamenting the long years of violence and killing:</p>
 <p>Some people wept, and not for sorrow -- joy</p>
 <p>That the king had armed and upped and sailed 
  for Troy,</p>
 <p>But inside me like struck sound in a gong</p>
 <p>That killing-fest, the life-warp and world-wrong</p>
 <p>It brought to pass, still augured and endured.</p>
 <p>I'd dream of blood in bright webs in a ford,</p>
 <p>Of bodies raining down like tattered meat</p>
 <p>On top of me asleep -- and me the lookout</p>
 <p>The queen's command had posted and forgotten,</p>
 <p>The blind spot her farsightedness relied on. 
  (29)</p>
 <p> Heaney positions himself in the five 
  poems not only as an observer and commentator but also as a prophet of the 
  destructive effects of war and of the future possibilities of victorious routing 
  and victimisation of the enemy:</p>
 <p>I balanced between destiny and dread</p>
 <p>And saw it coming, clouds bloodshot with the 
  red</p>
 <p>Of victory fires, the raw wound of that dawn</p>
 <p>Igniting and erupting, bearing down</p>
 <p>Like lava on a fleeing population... (30) </p>
 <p>Heaney also takes sympathy on a fellow social 
  observer and prophetess, Cassandra, who is caught up in the war and resembles 
  many of the people of Northern Ireland who become unwilling participants and 
  victims. Like O'Sullivan, he reflects that it is impossible to remain innocent 
  in a war, even for her:</p>
 <p>No such thing</p>
 <p>as innocent</p>
 <p>bystanding.(30)</p>
 <p>Cassandra, while being able to see into the 
  future, is tormented with the curse that no one will listen to her, and her 
  impotence as a marginalised spokesperson for her society, warning against 
  forthcoming violence parallels the position of Heaney, the watchman and social 
  commentator.</p>
 <p> Heaney expresses his frustration in 
  the poem that violence renders speech impotent and irrelevant. The war in 
  Northern Ireland has undermined democracy and free speech. Heaney has not 
  been free to say what he thinks for fear of reprisal. The watchman's statement 
  that "Our war stalled in the pre-articulate" (33) seems equally applicable 
  to his time of writing when talking had gone on for years but had had limited 
  effect as the gun continued to hold words at bay. Heaney further emphasises 
  the point by expanding on the Greek proverbial expression which Aeschylus's 
  watchman uses to imply that he is keeping silent: "the ox is on my tongue". 
  Heaney's watchman emphasises his self- regulated silence by elaborating and 
  modernising this image:</p>
 <p>And then the ox would lurch against the gong</p>
 <p>And deaden it and I would feel my tongue</p>
 <p>Like the dropped gangplank of a cattle truck,</p>
 <p>Trampled and rattled, running piss and muck,</p>
 <p>All swimmy-trembly as the lick of fire,</p>
 <p>A victory beacon in an abattoir... (29)</p>
 <p>There is amidst this elaborate imagery a note 
  of regret, that Heaney has been forced by the violent sectarian society to 
  govern his tongue &#151; what Seamus Deane, in another context, has called "typically 
  Heaneyesque... the old familiar shadowboxing, saying and not saying...eloquently 
  dumb, dumbly eloquent." (Deane 7)</p>
 <p> In addition to Cassandra, Heaney as 
  the watchman identifies with Atlas who holds up the world, brooding silently 
  and watching over it as its protector. To the watchman on the palace roof 
  who sits motionless, staring for hours, Atlas is a kind of supreme watchman 
  &#151; the "watchmen's patron":</p>
 <p>The ox's ton of dumb </p>
 <p>inertia stood, head-down</p>
 <p>and motionless as a herm.</p>
 <p>Atlas, watchmen's patron,</p>
 <p>would come into my mind,</p>
 <p>the only other one</p>
 <p>up at all hours, ox-bowed</p>
 <p>under his yoke of cloud</p>
 <p>out there at the world's end. (35)</p>
 <p> There is a sense in "Mycenae Lookout" 
  that although the watchman is at home at the palace, he is at the same time 
  a kind of outsider who does not approve of what is happening beneath the roof 
  of the palace &#151; the court intrigues, the love affair between Clytemnestra 
  and Aegisthus and the plotting against Agamemnon. And he blames himself for 
  failing to alert Agamemnon to the danger when he returns home.</p>
 <p>Like the watchman in "Mycenae Lookout", Heaney 
  is also a kind of outsider. He chose to leave Northern Ireland at the height 
  of the troubles in the 1970s. Following a threat by loyalist terrorists after 
  a television appearance, he moved his young family to County Wicklow outside 
  Dublin where he took up residence as a poet in internal exile. (Perhaps in 
  his representation of Cassandra, there were personal echoes for him relating 
  to his quick exit and the terror that paramilitaries would "do it to her 
  there and then&quot;.) In an earlier work, "Exposure", he wrote of being an 
  "inner &eacute;migr&eacute;" in Wicklow, looking towards the north (where his brother still 
  lives in County Derry on the family farm):</p>
 <p>I am neither internee nor informer;</p>
 <p>An inner &eacute;migr&eacute; grown long-haired</p>
 <p>And thoughtful; a wood-kerne</p>
 <p>Escaped from the massacre. (<em>Selected Poems</em> 
  91)</p>
 <p>There is a strong resonance in "Mycenae Lookout" 
  of Heaney peering from his isolated vantage point in Wicklow or more recently 
  from his Dublin home in Sandymount, honour-bound to keep peering over the 
  city of Dublin, at the distant hills, for signs of war beyond the border and 
  finally for a signal (such as a cease-fire) that the war has ended. In "Mycenae 
  Lookout", the watchman compares himself to a sheepdog, again evoking an image 
  of a kind of protector or watchful presence:</p>
 <p>For all the world a sheepdog stretched in grass,</p>
 <p>Exposed to what I knew, still honour-bound</p>
 <p>To concentrate attention out beyond the city</p>
 <p>and the border, on that line</p>
 <p>Where the blaze would leap the hills when Troy 
  had fallen. (29)</p>
 <p>In his earlier work such as "The Toome Road", 
  Heaney has described the impact of the war on his quiet pastoral life. He 
  recalls his dismay at the sight of armoured cars on a quiet country road that 
  disturb the peace but nevertheless cannot shake the centre of his universe 
  -- his "omphalos". (<em>Selected Poems</em> 96)</p>
 <p style='line-height:18.0pt'><span lang=CS>Likewise, in "Mycenae Lookout", 
  Heaney seems to record in a deeply personal way how the sight of delicate 
  flowers across the countryside makes him more conscious of wasted lives in 
  wartime, as he conjures up scenes of desolation and senseless violence:</p>
 <p>The little violets' heads bowed on their stems,</p>
 <p>The pre-dawn gossamers, all dew and scrim</p>
 <p>And star-lace, it was more through them</p>
 <p>I felt the beating of the huge time-wound</p>
 <p>We lived inside. (34)</p>
 <p> Nevertheless, despite the pollution 
  and degradation of war, Heaney, as in his adaptation of Sophocles' <em>Philoctetes, 
  </em>entitled <em>The Cure of Troy</em>, seems to find a cause for hope. Like 
  the watchman/ prophet, he is able to peer through the gloom and doom and spot 
  a light ahead. Rather than victory which calls up for Heaney images of revenge 
  and destruction, "Mycenae Lookout" ends on a note of redemption. Like <em>The 
  Cure at Troy</em> which warns the audience to "shun reprisal killings when 
  that's done" and ends with water images in the final lines of the chorus &#151; 
  </p>
 <p>Now it's high watermark</p>
 <p>And floodtide in the heart </p>
 <p>And time to go. (80)</p>
 <p style='line-height:18.0pt'><span lang=CS>&#151; "Mycenae Lookout" finishes with 
  a vision of "fresh water," a physical and spiritual cleansing. And again 
  modern images bring what is ostensibly a commentary on the Trojan War up 
  to date in scenes of peace-time bathing with</p>
 <p>fresh water</p>
 <p>in the bountiful round mouths of iron pumps</p>
 <p>and gushing taps. (37)</p>
 <p>Men who have been used to violence take risks 
  in this cleansing exercise, and try out new roles in a peaceful society:</p>
 <p>deeper in themselves for having been there,</p>
 <p>like discharged soldiers testing the safe ground. 
  (37)</p>
 <p>In conclusion, the two images of the watchman &#151; the sinister and implicated 
  observer in O'Sullivan's film and the benevolent and distanced visionary of 
  Heaney's poems &#151; seem worlds apart, and of course reflect the times in which 
  they were each produced &#151; O'Sullivan's during the dark days of the troubles 
  and Heaney's during the peace initiative. But as the dialogue in the Northern 
  Ireland peace process reaches another critical stage asa result of the recent 
  election success of the DUP, both types of watchman seem appropriate metaphors 
  for the current political situation. We as watchmen seem to be looking down 
  a long road with a fork in it. One fork leads to reconciliation while the 
  other to years of continuing violence. And the implication in O'Sullivan's 
  film of the spectator as not only a witness but also an agent in the northern 
  troubles seems as relevant now as when it was first screened.</p>
