<div class=Section1> <h3><b>Classics and Its Position  in Future Cultural Politics</b></h3>
 <p><b>by Freddy  Decreus</b><b><br>
  </b>University of Gent</p>
 <p>One of the riddles,  which, for a number of years, <span class=GramE>has</span> continued  to fascinate me is the relationship between Greek tragedy (as a literary  construction) and the tragic feeling (as a philosophical and ontological  problem). The classical philologist in me has been trained to study  questions like the translation and the meaning of Greek and Latin  tragedies, to interpret the way they are interrelated and to discuss  their contribution to 'classics'. However, when this classicist meets  the actor and the director in the rehearsal room, or when, in daily  theatre criticism, he discusses contemporary arts and the relevance  of tragedy for present-day artistic or religious processes, he enters  into another world, where he feels alone, orphaned, alienated. He  is asked why this capitalist society wants to stage so many tragedies  and why this community returns, characterized as it is by so many  POST-feelings (post-modern, post-dramatic, post-structuralist, post-human,  post-colonial, post-phallogocentric, post-ideological...), to the very  confusing notion of the tragic? On top of that, he must try to find  out whether or not the heritage of Ionesco and Beckett, Sarah Kane  and Botho Strauss can be considerd as tragic theatre. Is it the same,  but different? Can postmodern theatre, especially in its postdramatic  form, still be considered as tragic? Why is only the West largely  dominated by tragic feelings, and not the East? Why is no Western  university interested in offering real comparative mythology and philosophy?  </p>
<p>In the heat of discussions 
 like these, classicists realize that traditional 'classics' never fully explored 
 the philosophical consequences of a tragic worldview and that they are not well 
 informed about the German idealistic 18<sup>th</sup> century that produced philosophers 
 like Kant, Schelling, Schiller and H&ouml;lderlin, who all keep on influencing 
 central European interpretations of the tragic. Neither did they study the Dionysian 
 notions of dismemberment and ecstasy outside of the classical texts. Therefore, 
 this classicist feels uncomfortable when confronted with the theatre of the 
 <i>Fura Del Baus</i> or the <i>Societas Rafaello Sanzio</i>, when provoked by 
 the new anthropological theories of Girard or Bataille, when questioned by the 
 radical philosophy of Deleuze (against totalizing theory) and Sloterdijk (against 
 contemporary metaphysics). He is not used to comparing the tragic depth-structure 
 of the new kinds of drama written by Jan Lauwers, Pina Bausch, Meg Stuart or 
 Jan Fabre with the more classical ones. Hans-Thies Lehmann, in his very provocative 
 book <i>Postdramatisches Theater</i> (1999), introduced him to a whole new way 
 of thinking about drama, but notions like heterogeneity, pluralism, subversion, 
 deformation, gesticulation, seem unfamiliar, although he knows very well that 
 the great directors of today all use postdramatic techniques, even in the staging 
 of classical tragedies. The staging of drama does not necessarily any longer 
 respect clearly recognizable events and characters presented in an Aristotelean 
 way, but privileges moments and climates of anti-mimetic intensity, violence 
 or discontinuity which convey the postmodern lifestyle and its lack of traditional 
 metanarratives. Therefore, contemporary classicists, trained and raised as they 
 are by an <i>episteme</i> that still reflects a nineteenth-century vision of 
 the world (likewise, the organisation of the university curriculum), are often constrained 
 from discussing art, culture and society in a fundamental and enlighting new 
 way. Since they are not thinking in the categories that dominate contemporary 
 intellectual discussions, they cannot share the preoccupations of some of his 
 colleagues and therefore they still situate 'classics' in a more old-fashioned 
 paradigm of research.</p>
 <p>Talking about the future of  classics and the chance that it will be accepted as an important interlocutor  both in present and future discussions about cultural politics and  identity, one has to consider the need of integrating contemporary  visions on aesthetics, philosophy and ideology into our curricula.  Bridging the distance between old and new has always been one of the  central aims of Western 'humanities', and especially in an era which  has been accused of creating a "Bonfire of the Humanities' we must  investigate where a fight between (neo)conservatives and progressives  is leading us.</p>
