 <p>This issue marks  the tenth anniversary of <i>Didaskalia</i>, and is the first to be  published in association with the Open University. Both the practice  and study of ancient drama in performance have been transformed almost  beyond recognition since our first issue was published in March 1994,  so it seemed like a good time to take stock. We will be publishing  three issues this year. Following the current issue, 'Developments  and Trends in Contemporary Research', a second issue will survey and  assess the several 'Contemporary Electronic Research Initiatives'  that have gradually been changing the ways in which we research, teach  and learn about ancient drama as theatrical and textual phenomena  in antiquity and since. The final issue of 2004 will examine 'Responses  to Ancient Drama in Contemporary Performance', asking directors, performers,  playwrights, designers, critics, academics, and theatre-goers to contribute  their perspectives upon the uses to which ancient drama is, or could  be, put in performance today. (Further details are available in the  <a href="../../listings/callforpapers/call141103.html">Call for Papers</a>.)</p>
 <p>Is ten a good  age to be? These are the high days of childhood, when we can run faster,  jump higher, shout louder than ever, and when the growing pains, the  painfulness of self-consciousness, and the terrors of the teens have  yet to touch us. There is certainly a lot of running and jumping going  on where ancient drama is concerned - as the articles in this issue  attest, we live in exciting times. Not only is the stage unprecedentedly  packed with new stagings, translations, versions, and variations on  the themes of ancient drama, but scholars have been doing their fair  share of shouting too: new books on ancient drama in performance are  veritably hopping off the press, and the research circuit is spinning  with ever more dizzying rapidity, from conference to colloquium, and  symposium to 'star'-lecture. The 'classics' are no longer just demanding  to be taken seriously, they are in demand. </p>
 <p>But with expanding  boundaries may come a loss of one's accustomed sense of security.  As Pat Easterling writes: &quot;the challenge for everyone with an  interest in ancient drama is to get used to the notion that an art  form which until recently has been the preserve [...] of elites is  becoming a popular medium...&quot; It seems as if we are already,  somewhat precociously, approaching a 'coming-of-age'. <b>Freddy  Decreus </b>poses the dilemma of classicists, trained to regard the  world within a tradition that owes more to nineteenth-century philology  than to the <i>epistemes</i> of the late twentieth- and twenty-first-centuries,  but who are also called upon by their own age to make sense of what  tragedy and the tragic might mean for cultural politics and identity  for a postmodern worldview. Warning that contemporary classicists  are often constrained &quot;from discussing art, culture and society  in a fundamental and enlighting new way,&quot; he throws down the  gauntlet to classicists to consider &quot;integrating contemporary  visions on aesthetics, philosophy and ideology into our curricula.&quot;</p>
 <p>A common chorus  in this issue is a call for researchers urgently to apply themselves  to the creation of a methodology for performance reception that is  sufficiently supple to accommodate itself to the shifting contours  of ancient drama as it moves across time, language and culture, but  firm enough to provide a shared point of reference for international  and interdisciplinary communication. <b>Pat  Easterling</b> surveys a number of recent publications, noting that  &quot;the challenge is to find a systematic way of discussing and  evaluating&quot; the vast range of materials, issues and perspectives  that we encounter today. Marking important critical and archival milestones  in recent years, as well as developments in electronically-enabled  exchange, she cautions that there are many areas in which our efforts  are nevertheless still immature: &quot;there is still much to be done  before we can systematically debate fundamental issues like the status  of the 'original' text in modern performance, or refine our definition  of the guiding principles of reception studies.&quot; The long tradition  of &quot;the study of all aspects of the culture of antiquity that  might throw light on performance&quot;, has produced a remarkable  outpouring of publications in the last decade, augmented by innovative  approaches including the use of 3-dimensional visualisation technologies,  and research through performance. If, as mediators between antiquity  and the present, scholars have more than a little in common with translators,  we should be glad that our progeny has now outgrown us and decided  to make its own way in the world (and perhaps try not to be too disappointed  if it returns only on the occasional weekend clutching a bag full  of dirty washing). </p>
 <p>The exchanges now taking place amongst scholars and  practitioners have acquired a new degree of maturity in recent years,  no longer perceived as a barely concealed territorial dispute between  two ostensibly polite neighbours over a garden fence, but rather something  more akin to a &quot;bring-and-share&quot; neighbourhood barbeque  - collaboration has replaced mere civility. <i>Didaskalia</i> is a  case in point, jointly edited by a theatre historian and a classicist,  both of whom also actively explore the intersection between practice  and research. Nevertheless, <b>Lorna Hardwick</b> here rightly identifies  &quot;an urgent need for empirical and theoretical research frameworks  to be more closely linked and for practice-based research to be better  integrated with the work done by classicists and theatre historians.&quot;  As research priorities for the future, Hardwick proposes attention  be given to: &quot;the way in which the ancient texts have moved through  translations and performances in different times, places and cultures,&quot;  and &quot;the impact of non-Western theatrical traditions on modern  performances and on how relationships to the ancient theatre are perceived.&quot;</p>
 <p><b>Fiona Macintosh</b>  considers both transmission and reception: how the ancient play-texts  and 'classical learning' have come down to us, and how theatre artists,  audiences and academics have received ancient drama. She offers a  timely, and poignant, reminder of how an &quot;uninterrupted tradition  of 'classical learning' [...] was sustained in Byzantium and the Arabic  and Syriac scholarly traditions, especially Baghdad,&quot; arguing  that modern performance reception is incomplete without an understanding  of these earliest chapters in the transmission of &quot;Western&quot;  culture. She goes on to advocate &quot;a rigorous and systematic study  of operatic and balletic treatments of the ancient plays&quot; if  we are to be able to appreciate &quot;the sheer breadth of influence  exerted by Greek drama throughout the entire modern period.&quot;  She challenges us to question both how and why we undertake to study  the performance reception of antiquity.</p>
 <p>While <b>Alan Sommerstein</b> reports on exciting  new developments at the Centre for Ancient Drama and Its Reception  (CADRE) at the University of Nottingham, including two major new projects,  on oaths and masculinity in ancient drama,  in the  last article in this section of the issue, <b>Angie Varakis</b> discusses  developments in research on the ancient theatre mask, and gives an  impressive account of the increasing range of theatre practitioners  and researchers who have turned their attention to the effects of  the mask upon performers and audiences, ancient and modern. Varakis  reminds us that &quot;the insistence of our culture on facial acting  is a peculiarity of the modern world.&quot; We are currently discussing  a future issue to be dedicated to this crucial area of research -  hopefully many of the names and projects that appear fleetingly in  Varakis' invaluable survey here will appear fully clad on these pages  in due course. </p>
 <p><b>Steve Wilmer</b> contributes an article on the  figure of the Watchman in Thaddeus O'Sullivan's 1991 film <i>In the  Border Country</i>, and Seamus Heaney's poem sequence, &quot;Mycenae  Lookout&quot;, published in 1996. The themes of vigilance and the  impossibility of innocence when subjected to a world of viciousness  are overlaid onto ancient myths, and juxtaposed with the seemingly  inescapable reciprocity of violence in Northern Ireland. One might  add that O'Sullivan's film could be seen to imply that we become more,  rather than less, complicit in savagery when choosing to observe present  crises through the violent myths of antiquity. Heaney's &quot;Mycenae  Lookout&quot;, by contrast, extends the possibility of a deeper &quot;spiritual  cleansing.&quot;</p>
 <p>The Reviews listed  here were also published in the<em> Didaskalia</em>-APA Listings when  first received. Individually and collectively, they provide a vivid  record of some of the most important and fascinating productions yet  reviewed in <em>Didaskalia</em>. Finally, Paul Wignall publishes the  <a href="../../studyarea/texts/BurstingTheGrape.rtf">full script</a>  of his new play, <em>Bursting the Grape</em>, first performed at The  Eden Project in Cornwall last October, and reviewed by Elizabeth Stewart  in this issue.</p>
 <p><i>Didaskalia</i>  has come a long way since its birth as a series of text-only files  to retrieved by using such FTP software as &quot;Gopher&quot;. For  those of us who seem to spend much of our lives entangled in the world-enveloping  Web, it is salutary to recall that, as recently as December 1994,  an editorial was required to explain the concept of the Web:</p>
  
  <blockquote> 
  <p>WWW files are connected to one another through hypertext links: by clicking on highlighted text you can move back and forth between documents, making for easy cross-referencing. (<a href="../vol1no5/editorial.html">Editorial, Volume 1, Issue 5</a>)</p>
 
  </blockquote>
  <p>The Editor at that time rightly predicted that: &quot;even those of you presently restricted to retrieving <i>Didaskalia </i>by ftp or asking for files by e-mail should be able to get onto it within the next year or so.&quot; </p>
		 <p>Along with the  changing format came an expanded sense of what <i>Didaskalia </i>might  be, growing out of Oliver Taplin's original proposal for an electronic  notice board, collecting and disseminating news and information, and  Sallie Goetsch's vision of providing, through an online journal, a  place in which people could be &quot;exposed to one another's ideas.&quot;  If some of the other early aspirations for <i>Didaskalia </i>now seem  overly ambitious&#151;the intervening years have educated us in the  pitfalls, as well as the possibilities, of the Information Age&#151;in  other ways, we and others have exceeded the expectations of those  infant days. Now, for the first time, <i>Didaskalia </i>enjoys a secure,  technical and administrative infrastructure, enabling us properly  to plan and coordinate our activities, and to consider from a less  beleaguered position how we might best serve our community. A small  indication is the new form on the home-page, allowing readers to sign-up  for a regular e-mail bulletin of listings of performances, conferences,  and publications of interest. Behind the scenes, too, is an ever-increasing  level of activity as word spreads, and a greater volume of new articles,  reviews, listings, and enquiries flows in. An outline of the range  of<i> Didaskalia</i>'s current activities can be reviewed at the online  <a href="../../didguide.html">Guide to Didaskalia</a>, while a <a href="../../listings/news.html">News</a>  page keeps readers informed about current and future activities.</p>
 <p>Our thanks go  to Lorna Hardwick for sharing in our vision of <i>Didaskalia</i>'s  role in helping to connect and to support the expanding international  community of researchers, practitioners, educators and students who  share an interest in Greek and Roman drama in performance. We also  owe a considerable debt to Carol Gillespie, our expert Administrator  and Assistant Editor, working with us as a result of our new association  with the Open University. It has taken fully a year of hard work and  extensive consultation by many people to establish the relationship,  move the website to its new home, and consolidate our work. </p>
 <p>What will the  next ten years hold for <i>Didaskalia</i>? Age ten may be a time of  vitality, anticipation and incipient coming of age, but the greatest  achievements and discoveries, still lie ahead. Who knows but that  the World-Wide Web itself may be transformed into a three-dimensional  spatial metaphor - a kind of networked, parallel universe. By the  time we bring our second decade to a close, perhaps we may even be  performing with one another in the ancient theatres of the future.<br>
