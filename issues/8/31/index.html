<blockquote class="amys_blockquote">
We present here in its entirety the video recording of the keynote address by Kenneth Reckford, entitled, "Euripides' <em>Hecuba</em>: the Text and the Event," in which he gives his ideas about the two parts of <em>Hecuba</em> and the loss of innocence, and how we might understand how Euripides engages Aristotelian catharsis and recognition.  The talk, however, ranges widely as Reckford touches on Shakespeare and Ibsen and Stoppard, the prickly difficulties of translation and collaboration, what constitutes the shocking, and, in general, what changes and what endures in the theater.</blockquote>
