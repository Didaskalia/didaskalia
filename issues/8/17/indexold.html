<h2>Introduction</h2>
<!--<strong>by Brett Rogers</strong><br />
<em>Gettysburg College</em>

<p>To describe <em>Theater of War</em> (hereafter <em>ToW</em>) as &lsquo;theater,&rsquo; or &lsquo;a theatrical event,&rsquo; or even a &lsquo;performance&rsquo; is to surely miss the point. Working from the argument that Attic Greek drama was primarily (though not exclusively) a mode of performance &ldquo;by veterans, for veterans,&rdquo; Bryan Doerries&mdash;<em>ToW</em>&rsquo;s creator, creative director, and one of its producers&mdash;focuses the event on multiple activities that dramatize the experience (and costs) of warfare and provoke discussion about them.<span class="footnote" href="#">1</span>&nbsp; The event itself falls into three stages. First, four to five professional actors sit at a table on a bare stage&mdash;no costumes, no props, no sets, no make-up, no special lighting—and perform a reading of Sophocles&rsquo; <em>Ajax</em> or <em>Philoctetes</em>. Next, the actors are replaced by another small group, made up of citizens, including veterans, often a veteran&rsquo;s spouse, and usually a therapist with experience treating combat veterans, all of whom offer their own comments and experience. Finally, Doerries (in the role of emcee) invites the audience to talk about their reactions to the performance and comments, passing the microphone around. The entire event lasts approximately two hours, although discussions linger afterward.</p>
<p>In other words, <em>ToW</em> sits at the interstices between theatrical event and social tool. It is part classical homage, part Sophoclean revival, part town-hall meeting, part therapeutic group session, part social-impact project.  Were it not for Doerries&rsquo;s careful management of the audience, always steering the audience conversation back to the text of the performance,&nbsp;there is no little risk that <em>ToW</em> could also become part heated—even explosive—public debate on contemporary American military policy. In the open discussion, audience members speak thoughtfully, tearfully, passionately, even angrily. There is a simmering of communal emotion among the audience reminiscent not of the darkness of contemporary theater, but rather of the colorful, emotion-filled anecdotes found in the vitae of the Attic dramatists themselves. In short, <em>ToW</em> is a unique kind of event, a compelling amalgam of artifice and grassroots  asks (and answers)  how ancient drama can serve society more than 2,400 years after the genre&rsquo;s initial apogee. </p>
<p>We do not offer an extensive review of <em>ToW</em> here, in part because it is an ongoing, traveling event that changes as its  locations,  cast members, and  audiences change. Since its inception in 2009, there have been over one hundred and fifty  performances at multiple hospitals, military bases, theaters, and universities—including recently (and perhaps &nbsp;significantly) Guantanamo Bay.<span class="footnote" href="#">2</span>&nbsp;  Rather, given its protean nature, <em>ToW</em> seems a better subject for an <em>inter</em>view that  offers a glimpse of the production  as it moves from military communities and increasingly into the public sphere. One of  our main lines of inquiry   in our conversation with Doerries and regular actor Elizabeth Marvel (&lsquo;Tecmessa&rsquo; in <em>Ajax</em> and &lsquo;Ajax&rsquo; in the female version of <em>Ajax</em> )  addressed how <em>ToW</em> has developed and changed over time in terms of format, meaning, and impact.</p>
<p>We hope that this interview will appeal to a wide variety of audiences: classicists, thespians, theater goers, veterans, and those interested in <em>ToW</em>. Our goal was to create a conversation that might have both general  and specialist interest. Part One (featuring both Doerries and Marvel) may appeal more to a general audience, while Part Two  (featuring Doerries) probes  more deeply into questions  of interest to those engaged in ancient performance.</p>
<p> Scholars may rightfully wonder whether <em>ToW</em> offers any meaningful insight into ancient performance.  With its clear social aim,  does <em>ToW</em> belong  rather to the annals of contemporary theater history or reception studies? In Part Two, Doerries at one point suggests that part of his aim with <em>ToW</em> is in fact archaeological, to &ldquo;excavate&rdquo; and uncover the emotions and ideas of an ancient Athenian (male, soldier) audience. Doerries&rsquo;s claim places him somewhat in league with a contemporary scholarly trend to examine the role of emotion in classical drama (e.g., Konstan 2001 and 2006, ADD MORE HERE -- articles/books on fear, pity, etc.). We leave it to others to ask at least two  further questions.  First, how would we go about substantiating such a claim? Second, does or should this  claim change the way we read, study, and perform Attic drama?</p>
<p>The interviews were recorded on April 4th, 2011, at Transition Productions  in New York City. Bryan Doerries and Elizabeth Marvel are interviewed by Amy R. Cohen (editor, <em>Didaskalia</em>) and Brett M. Rogers (editorial board, <em>Didaskalia</em>). <em>Didaskalia</em> would like to offer thanks to  Ian Dempsey and Mitch Cheney for producing this interview.</p>

    <p><sup>1</sup> In conversation, Doerries (among others) attributes this observation to the clinical psychiatrist Jonathan Shay, whose work repeatedly draws connections between Greek epic and drama and the communalized experience of soldiers and veterans; see <em>Achilles in Vietnam </em>(1994), <em>Odysseus in America </em>(2002), and, for our purposes here, &ldquo;The Birth of Tragedy—Out of the Needs of Democracy&rdquo; (Autumn 1995) in <a href="http://www.didaskalia.net/issues/vol2no2/shay.html" target="_blank"><em>Didaskalia </em>2.02.</a></p>
