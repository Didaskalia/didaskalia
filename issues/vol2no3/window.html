  <h3>======================<br>
 1995 Classical Association AGM<br>
 ======================</h3>
  <p>Douglas MacDowell of Glasgow ('Kleon and the sausage-seller')<br>
 discussed the portrayal of Kleon in Aristophanes' Knights. He<br>
 argued that many of the accusations made against Kleon in the play<br>
 may have had some firm basis in actuality.</p>
  <p>Andreas Fountoulakis of Manchester ('Ousia in Euripides,<br>
 Hippolytus 514 and the Greek magical papyri') began from a problem<br>
 of textual corruption in Euripides, Reiske's conjecture of plokon<br>
 for the mss. logon. By setting the passage in the context of other<br>
 references to magic in the Greek world, Fountoulakis showed that the<br>
 conjecture makes far more sense that the manuscript reading.</p>
  <p>Judith Mossman of Trinity College, Dublin ('Waiting for Neoptolemus:<br>
 Euripides' Andromache') argued for a reassessment of the<br>
 Andromache. She argued that the play is bound together by the<br>
 unseen figure of Neoptolemos, who, though he appears only at the end,<br>
 and then as a corpse, is the force that drives the action of the<br>
 whole play.</p>
  <p>Richard Seaford of Exeter ('New light on lightning: the<br>
 house-collapse in Euripides Bacchae') examined the destruction<br>
 Pentheus' house in the Bacchae. Seaford advanced evidence that the<br>
 thunderbolt and earthquake had an important role in Dionysiac<br>
 initiation in particular, and in rite-of-passage tales in general; he<br>
 ended with an interesting parallel from the life of St. Paul.</p>

  <h3>=====================<br>
 Ancient Comic Opera Company <br>
 =====================<br>
 <br>
 Aristophanes' Clouds and Lysistrata</h3>
  <p>Translated and adapted by A.C.O.C.'s founder and artistic director <br>
 Greg Robic</p>
  <p>At the Poor Alex Theatre in downtown Toronto<br>
 296 Brunswick Avenue (just west of Bloor and Spadina)</p>
  <p><em>Clouds</em><br>
 Tues.-Sat. 8:00 p.m.; Sun. 2:30 p.m.<br>
 Tickets as low as Can.$12.50 for groups<br>
 to Can.$24.50 for adults on Fri/Sat.</p>
  <p><em>Lysistrata</em><br>
 Thurs. 10:30; Fri, Sat. midnight<br>
 Can.$10.00 for students, Can.$12.50 for adults</p>
  <p>DETAILS:</p>
  <p><em>Clouds</em> is a rambunctious musical comedy about <br>
 Socrates and his fanatical students in Ancient Athens. While <br>
 skewering modern university education, this preposterous play <br>
 features irreverent parodies of popular songs from Gilbert and <br>
 Sullivan, Mozart, Verdi, Bellini, Handel, and Slovenian polkas. At <br>
 the Athenian Festival of Dionysos in 423 B.C., <em>Clouds</em> won 3rd prize <br>
 (out of 3 plays), but Robic's bold and innovative production captured the <br>
 Best Director Award at the 1995 Hart House Drama Festival.</p>
  <p><em>Lysistrata</em>has the women of Athens staging a sex strike to stop the men's <br>
 war. Can the brave Athenian men control themselves? Or is peace finally <br>
 in the cards? <em>Lysistrata</em> is a musical comedy about seduction and <br>
 frustration, war and peace, domination and submission. Robic shocks and <br>
 humours in his unforgettable adaptation of Aristophanes' most popular and <br>
 most explicit musical comedy.</p>

  <p>----------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
  <p>About the Festival</p>
  <p>The London Festival of Greek Drama is the only event of its kind in the<br>
 world: a three-week annual season of live performances, lectures, and<br>
 workshops, committed to bringing the experience of ancient Greek drama to<br>
 the widest possible modern audience. The 1996 Festival is devoted entirely<br>
 to tragedy, with new productions of major plays by Sophocles and <br>
 Euripides, and culminating in a unique reconstruction of one of the most <br>
 famous of all 'lost' tragedies.</p>
  <p>This year's opening lecture is by Professor Richard Buxton of the <br>
 University of Bristol, one of the world's foremost Sophoclean scholars, <br>
 and author of the acclaimed recent study of Greek myth <em>Imaginary Greece </em><br>
 (CUP). The lecture links to one of two new productions premiering this <br>
 week: Sophocles' <em>Ajax, </em>probably his earliest surviving play, is a <br>
 powerful, highly characteristic study of an extraordinary hero's self-<br>
 destruction and the subsequent struggle by family and comrades to make <br>
 sense of his life and death. The most Homeric of surviving Greek tragedies, <br>
 it looks simultaneously back to the <em>Iliad</em> and forward to Sophocles' later <br>
 studies of strong, stubborn individuals perilously at odds with their world.</p>
  <p>By contrast, Euripides' celebrated <em>Bacchae </em>was probably the last play its<br>
 author completed before his death in 406 BC: a richly troubling and<br>
 multi-layered tragedy on the violent collision of rational culture with<br>
 elemental nature in religion, mind, and society. This year the two<br>
 large-scale Festival productions have been programmed in the same week to<br>
 allow visitors from farther afield to see both plays in a single visit.<br>
 (Note that this means that the dates of the <em>Bacchae </em>are now a week earlier<br>
 than originally announced in some pre-publicity.) In a lecture at the<br>
 British Museum in the following week, Dr Nick Lowe will discuss all three<br>
 Festival plays in the light of new ways of understanding Greek tragedy's<br>
 overall history and development.</p>
  <p>Finally, a true first: the Festival culminates in the first performed<br>
 reconstruction of a lost Greek tragedy. In the third week, an illustrated<br>
 lecture at the British Museum by Chloe Productions (of the Institute of<br>
 Classical Studies) discusses and previews the Andromeda Project --a <br>
 venture to research and to reconstruct one of Euripides' most renowned lost <br>
 plays. This is followed in weeks 4 and 5 by a new English-language <br>
 production of the reconstructed <em>Andromeda</em> itself, in the Tristan Bates <br>
 Theatre at the Actors' Centre in Covent Garden. Originally performed in <br>
 412 BC, the <em>Andromeda </em>was one of Euripides' exciting, melodramatic <br>
 adventure-romances, described by one ancient critic as 'the most beautiful <br>
 of all Euripides' plays'. This unique series of performances seeks to present <br>
 the reconstructed play before a modern audience for the very first time.</p>
  <p>Accompanying the weekend evening performances are three special lectures <br>
 on the <em>Andromeda</em>'s reconstruction, themes, and depiction in art: by <br>
 Professor Chris Collard, co-author of a major new multi-volume edition of <br>
 the remains of Euripides' lost plays; Russell Shone, the Project Director; <br>
 and Dr Jenny March, a leading authority on Greek drama's representations <br>
 in art.</p>
