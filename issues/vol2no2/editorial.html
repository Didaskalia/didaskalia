  <h1>EDITORIAL:</h1>
  <h2>THE CRUELEST MONTH</h2>
  Some of you may remember that this issue was supposed to 
  come out in April. Some of you may also remember that in the February 
  editorial I gave a long lecture about deadlines. Some of you may be enjoying 
  the fact that I'm squirming. 
  <p> Well, it's true: while there were some people who had trouble meeting the deadlines for this issue--and some pieces which are still outstanding--the primary reason for this unconscionable delay lies with yours truly, the editor. 
  <p> In defense of myself I will say that <em>Didaskalia</em> has no budget at all. I have to do the considerable work involved in formatting files for the ASCII version and then <em>reformatting</em> them for the WWW version for free, in my alleged spare time. I badly need at least one on-location sub-editor, but can't afford one. 
  <p> So anyone with ideas about how to get this journal funded so we can expand as we ought to and not keep struggling to catch up, please let me know. 
  <p> In the meantime, the Editorial Board has agreed to take up the suggestion of one of our members that <em>Didaskalia</em> publish quarterly rather than bimonthly, in order to take some of the pressure off. 
  <p> That means the next issue will be Winter 1995 and will probably arrive sometime in late December or early January. The theme will be Roman Stagings. 
  <p> It also means that many listings will have 'expired' by the time an issue is published. New listings will be posted on the  <a href="../../listings/listings.html">Listings</a> page on our Website as they come in. Apologies to those of our readers who do not yet have Web access. 
  <p> I do hope that this issue proves to be worth the wait.
