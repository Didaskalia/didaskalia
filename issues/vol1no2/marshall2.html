 The performance that was filmed was outdoors. The bare concrete
 tile stage had no <i>skene</i>, but was merely surrounded by lush
 green vegetation. The Persian court symbolizes human
 encroachment on nature. There is nothing comfortable in the
 chorus. The twelve move in military formations (the rank-and-file
 partly inspired by Theatre du Soleil, as the director admitted in the
 discussion which followed). Faces were painted in imitation of
 kabuki masks, but with some features from other cultures, such as
 Indian red cheek-spots. The group singing and dancing
 (choreographed by Carolyn Wood) was unashamed and hypnotic,
 effectively using mock spears as props. Jeffrey Price's music had
 an oriental flavour, and punctuated the whole play with drums. The
 chorus makes guttural emoting sounds, twice murmurs Greek
 phrases as background to long speeches, and once emits a
 cacophonic shriek: this alone seems out of place.<br>
 <br>
 The actors are comfortable performing outdoors, especially Myk
 Watford's messenger (he doubled as Darius); they do not hesitate
 to make their actions big, as is necessary. Willard Knox's Atossa
 perhaps overused an outstretched hand (palm facing up and down)
 but made up for it in his singing as Xerxes. The actors occasionally
 blended in with the chorus, suggesting a lack of differentiation of
 questionable significance.<br>
 <br>
 The invocation of Darius (a real dance, with some Greek words,
 and the play's first pipe music) was accomplished by the waving of
 a long red silk, which had unintentional echoes of <i>Agamemnon</i>,
 and symbolized 'boldness' and 'blood', according to the director.
 It was overused (when Darius disappeared, so ought the silk to
 have), but its benefit to the scene was significant: like a slight-of-
 hand trick, the silk provided a distraction for Darius' subtle entry
 centre stage, having crossed from the side in plain view but behind
 the fluttering symbol. He did not seem ghost-like, but was clearly
 special.<br>
 <br>
 The song and dance of the play was exotic, and creative. I fear it
 may have hindered at certain points. While the crossing of the
 Hellespont was clear, the battle of Salamis was less so, if one did
 not know what to listen for. Some might say that the production
 undervalued Aeschylus' words, covering them with spectacle. The
 spectacle though gave a potency to the performance that was
 desirable: we were clearly seeing another culture, other from the
 Greeks and other from us. The message was not lost, and when the
 chorus filed off, sticks, caps, and other props lay strewn across the
 stage. Persia was wasted, because of Xerxes' attempt to tame
 nature. His rashness was clear from the ruins that remained.<br>
 <br>
 The filming of the play deserves some comment, because it is the
 greatest weakness of the production. The sound was terrible, and
 much was lost as multiple voices hit distant microphones. I
 recognize that there are certain limitations at work, but there was no
 need for most entrances to be edited out (when characters entered,
 they simply appeared in close up, which pulled back to reveal them
 standing centre stage; we never saw how the character arrived)
 which was very frustrating, and probably concealed what had been
 some nice effects.<br>
