 It is difficult to imagine a production of Aristophanes with a cast of
 four, no set, minimal costumes and eclectic props. But after
 viewing the Aquila Theatre companys performance last night I
 found Aristophanes had been served with a vengeance.<br>
 <br>
 The shallow lecture hall platform at Wayne State University in
 downtown Detroit was bare except for four microphones, a drum
 set and a lone guitar. Except for a lone Greek word scrawled on the
 floor in chalk, it looked like a low key folk concert was in store.
 But when the action began and the four hyperkinetic actors grabbed
 those microphones and let loose, there was no doubt about the
 theatricality of the performance. The audience was involved from
 the first moment. The actors were constantly moving through the
 auditorium, so that the aisles and seating area became an annex to
 the stage. ProCleon in particular was always in motion, pushing
 through the seats, insinuating himself in the laps of female audience
 members, engaging perople in conversation and often putting
 people on the spot. When the lone Wasp, who represented the
 Chorus, appeared armed with his stinger--a Supersoaker watergun-
 -then the relationship became even more direct. Audience members
 were cajoled into joining in with the Chorus and unless they
 buzzed on command they were sprayed without mercy. As well,
 the company cleverly used audience members to fill in the cast or
 the action. One young man was brought onstage as the donkey
 complete with paper bag head. Another was found at the bottom of
 a pile of actors after the fight between Anti-Cleon and the Chorus.
 During the Agon, the Chorus sat on the arms of two seats in the
 front row and conducted a Kazoo orchestra of audience members.
 As well, the final scene might have aptly been subtitled 'insulting
 the audience', for a group of patrons was hauled up to form a
 Conga line for the final dance and were brought forward one by
 one and teased by ProCleon.<br>
 <br>
 This was all done in good humor and was outrageous but not
 offensive. It felt very appropriate to the energy of Aristophanes. It
 was hard to sit back and judge such a participatory production as a
 critic. I must admit that I kept my pen and paper well out of sight
 when the actors were roaming and I buzzed with the best of them!<br>
 <br>
 One of the great virtues of the production was its ability to both
 entertain and teach. The text was very clear and there were some
 wonderful choices of stage action to elucidate Aristophanes. The
 Agon, for instance, was handled as a trial and a lesson. Xanthias
 listed the points for and against ProCleon on a large blackboard.
 The slave, appropriately played by a mulatto actor, filled the board
 with the benefits of jury service: bribes, Cleonsfavor, drink, sex
 etc. and then during Anti-Cleons rebuttal he erased the words one
 by one until the slate was empty. The parabasis was equally clear.
 The actor who played the Chorus and bit parts came to a podium
 dressed as a clergyman and created a comic but very scary Calvinist
 character. The dramatic effect of this was achieved with the help of
 a hand-held safety light,which he sometimes focused on himself
 and sometimes on members of the audience. The harsh lighting set
 off the actors sculpted features and wild hair. The sense of
 intimidation he conveyed was enhanced when he turned this
 interrogation light onto the audience. Producer Peter Meineck
 admitted that this clergyman was based on conservative religious
 leader Ian Paisley, and indeed, a very effective caricature was
 drawn.<br>
 <br>
 When I directed my first production of Aristophanes I was told that
 his style was about as reverent as a television program like
 'Saturday Night Live.' There was a real sense that anything could
 happen, that no one was spared, that contemporary political satire,
 improvisation and low humor were the tools of the trade. The
 Aquila production certainly had the kind of slightly mad
 improvisatory energy of these television shows and felt true to the
 spirit of Aristophanes as I have come to know it.<br>
 <br>
 American audiences who want to experience a truly Aristophanic
 performance will be happy to know that Aquila Productions is
 planning to include <i>Wasps</i> in its spring 1995 tour along with a
 new version of Sophocles <i>Philoctetes</i> and Shakespeares
 <i>Macbeth</i>.<br>
