 <br>
 The <i>Antigone</i> production by the RO-Theater, announced in<br>
 <i>Didaskalia</i> 1.1, has been cancelled. The director had based her<br>
 interpretation of the play on the horrors of the Bosnian war.<br>
 According to a newspaper report, there were differing opinions<br>
 about her approach, which eventually made her decide to withdraw.<br>
 The direction was taken over by someone else, but apparently it<br>
 was no longer possible to raise the production to an acceptable<br>
 level. ==============<br>

 &gt;From the program: &quot;The composer is drawn ... to what he feels is<br>
 the essence of the myth: the Buddhist view that man can only attain<br>
 'freedom' by accepting his existence as it is. In Qu Xiaosong's<br>
 music, a fertile confrontation takes place between contemporary<br>
 Western music and age-old Asian traditions. Qu is a master of the<br>
 tense silence.&quot;<br>
