 This is not a review for those who are interested in lighting and
 directing. People who know about these things may mutter that the
 former was uninspired and the latter weak in places. But neither
 perceived fault impaired my enjoyment of the plays. This is a
 review for those who enjoy hearing about undergraduates
 enthusiastically involving themselves in Classical dramas, and who
 love going to the theatre, laughing themselves sick and then
 embarrassing themselves by giggling, without apparent cause, all
 the way home on the streetcar.<br>
 <br>
 This past March Mr. Greg Robic, an undergraduate at this
 university, sought to prove that the success he and his friends
 enjoyed last season was no accident. A sold-out house on opening
 night testified to the happy memories of last year's audience. As the
 lights dimmed on this double-bill the anticipation in the hall was
 almost like that of children on Christmas morning.<br>
 <br>
 The <i>Lysistrata</i> is a revival of last year's production with the
 addition of a few more songs. On the whole it is too good a show
 to let wither away unrepeated. The translation sticks fairly close to
 the original, allowing for a certain amount of <i>modernizing</i> such
 as the women vowing to dial '911' if their desperate husbands try
 to force the issue on them.<br>
 <br>
 The <i>Clouds</i> is this year's effort, and is, I think, a year better than
 the <i>Lysistrata</i>. It seemed a tighter production, and the absence of
 the agon was no loss. The sense that the final scene, when
 Strepsiades fires the school, is merely tacked on, is a fault of the
 play itself and not of this version. The addition of a second chorus
 of Socrates' students worked nicely and provided some fine comic
 touches and a very good song. The portrayal of Socrates as a
 combination of arrogant, self-worshipping professor and
 psychopath was just delightful as was the interplay between
 Socrates and the chief Cloud who was responsible for Strepsiades'
 testing.<br>
 <br>
 What makes anything involving Greg Robic worth the price of
 admission, however, is his ability to write the most outrageous and
 wonderfully insane lyrics to some of the most famous tunes from
 Broadway, Gilbert and Sullivan, and opera. He proved his skill
 last year in the <i>Lysistrata</i> with such hits as 'Tragedy' (to the
 music of 'Tradition' from <i>Fiddler on the Roof</i>) and 'The
 Freudian and the Classicist Should be Friends'. Both are
 impossible to forget and deserve (O Cruel Fate!) to be
 recommended reading in intro. civ. courses. This year's crop from
 the <i>Clouds</i> is no less fantastic. Socrates' introduction song, to
 the music of the policemen's song from G. and S.'s <i>Pirates of
 Penzance</i>, is probably better than the original, at least for a crowd
 which can appreciate the lyrics. What Strepsiades does to the
 Queen of the Night's aria from Mozart's <i>The Magic Flute</i> is
 perfectly criminal. If you ever hear this version, Mozart's lyrics
 will never sound serious again.<br>
 <br>
 This new production of the <i>Clouds</i> is true to Aristophanes'
 original intent in a most unexpected fashion. Little did the audience
 suspect that it was still possible for contemporary (and Classical!)
 scholarship to become a subject for song and dance. Nevertheless
 'No Cock Fights Today', Socrates and the chorus' attempt to
 expatiate on the theme of the Athenian reaction to encounters
 between fellow citizens, seemed an excellent summary of Eric
 Csapo's recent series of articles in <i>Phoenix</i> 47 (1993).<br>
 <br>
 Both productions are characterized by Robic's lyrical insanity,
 which seems so natural on stage that one is left wondering why
 someone has not written these songs before. The whole show felt
 as is it were full of energetic goodwill. The actors were fully alive
 and gave the appearance of being happy to be there, and they
 managed on the whole, I think, to communicate that feeling to the
 audience. Which is why any production faults ought to be
 forgiven. There is always a fear that the excessive organization of
 happy amateurs will destroy the peculiar charms of the
 unprofessional production.<br>
 <br>
 One can only hope that Greg Robic's professors have the good
 sense to fail him and thus keep him a perpetual undergraduate,
 perpetually producing wonderful musicals for grateful audiences.<br>
