 NEW OPTION FOR HYDRA WORKSHOP ON ANCIENT GREEK THEATER<br>
 <br>
 July 1-August 14, 1994<br>
 <br>
 NEW APPLICATION DEADLINE: JUNE 1<br>
 <br>
 The summer of 1994 will inaugurate a unique theater workshop and academy on the Greek island of Hydra. The virtue of the Hydra Workshop of Ancient Greek Theater is its combination of theory and practice, the bringing together of scholar and artist in the study and appreciation of ancient Greek drama. The island, an artists' colony where cars are prohibited, is two hours from the ancient theater festivals which take place every summer in Epidavros and Athens. (Editor's note: See Listings: Performances: UK and Europe for the 1994 Epidavros and Athens schedules.)<br>
 <br>
 For the six-week program students will enroll in two comprehensive courses, one in the origins, development, religious and historical background of ancient Greek drama, and one in theater, involving voice, movement, dance, acting, directing, and stage design. The classes will build toward a small production of a single ancient work which involves all students. The Workshop will also offer Friday seminars on 'Ancient Drama in Modern Dress' and 'Cinematic Adaptations of Greek Drama.'<br>
 <br>
 The guiding theme of the program is the need for a rigorous and fresh appraisal of the ancient dramatic works for modern audiences. We hope that Hydra will become a place where students, classical scholars, and experts in theater and film can come together to discuss the interpretation and presentation of ancient drama. To that end the founders of the Hydra Worskhop envision an Hydra Symposium for the exchange of ideas.<br>
 <br>
 The new, reduced, enrollment fee of US $2,900 includes tuition, room with breakfast, field trip to the Peloponnese, and some additional meals. Internships and group rates are available.<br>
