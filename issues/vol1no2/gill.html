 1994 production of <i>Easy Virtue: A Reconstruction of Plautus'
 Cistellaria</i> at the University of Michigan.]<br>
 <br>
 When I started working on the score for <i>Easy Virtue</i>, I originally
 intended to make it entirely a jazz composition with some sort of
 music behind the whole production. I worked on this idea for about
 a month, scribbling all my musical inspirations on the script of the
 play and thinking through mentally what types of jazz would be
 appropriate to the drastically changing moods of the play.<br>
 <br>
 The next step was to actually compose and perform the music. This
 proved to be the most difficult part of the project. I didn't have the
 instrumentation or the musicians available at the times I wanted
 them to play the music I had come up with. Also, their
 backgrounds in music were very different from mine, ranging from
 classical to gritty blues. It would be extremely difficult to
 coordinate everyone and arrange the amount of practice time needed
 to make my vision concrete. We simply didn't have the time to
 teach everyone to play jazz.<br>
 <br>
 To combat this problem, I turned to a MIDI hookup to a Macintosh
 PowerBook, and a MIDI capable key pad. Through this medium, I
 had all the instrumentation that I could ever want and more. MIDI
 also created another problem however: I couldn't get the jazz sound
 I wanted. A digital instrument simply doesn't sound like jazz. This
 was the final problem that convinced me to change my approach to
 using more traditional music for this type of production.<br>
 <br>
 I composed marches, disco, some blues, a waltz, and a few other
 short songs that would be used on the transitions between character
 exits and entrances. I recorded the music onto a tape and
 experimented with playing it during a few of the rehearsals. There
 were problems with the timing of the music versus that of the play.
 The time that scenes took to complete in the play varied quite a bit
 depending on the energy of the actors and the different ways that
 they interacted with each other. The tape was static, and always
 took the same amount of time to play, so I had to work a lot with
 cutting it off short at certain places that I wrote into the music that
 could work as endings to the songs if they had to.<br>
 <br>
 I never refined these songs past the second version, which was still
 a bit sloppy, because I wanted to get the approval of the instructors
 before putting a great deal of time into the music, in case they
 didn't think it would go with the play. As it turned out, they did
 approve of the music, but there were other complications that
 arose. The main problem, and the one that turned out to be the
 biggest obstacle to the use of MIDI music, was the difficulty of
 obtaining the proper equipment to play this music. This equipment
 would also have been extremely difficult to set up and take down
 every performance.<br>
 <br>
 In the end, I was forced to do everything acoustically. The only
 instruments that I had to work with were a piano, my saxophone,
 and a harmonica which one of the actors played. In order to turn
 the MIDI songs into their acoustic counterparts, I had to learn
 music which I had never intended to memorize. Fortunately this
 wasn't hard, and in less than one practice session I had a pretty
 good grasp of what I was going to play for the performances.<br>
 <br>
 The fact that I was responsible for the majority of the music and
 that I was playing it by myself with no backup led to an interesting
 conclusion. I could play a majority of jazz after all. I decided that
 most of what I played would be improvised. I've played quite a bit
 of piano and saxophone jazz, both solo and in a band, so I was
 confident that I could pull it off. I ended up improvising everything
 for the first dress rehearsal and polishing it for the second dress
 and the performances.<br>
 <br>
 The final version of the music was basically what I had envisioned
 in the first place, but instead of a band it was me playing simplified
 versions of the music I had thought of at the beginning of the
 project. Aside from the fact that it was difficult for me to see what
 was happening on stage from behind the piano, it was a really
 enjoyable experience. I've only played piano in front of that many
 people a few times before, and I was used to playing my sax
 primarily for a groups of six or seven people who would ask me to
 play in our high school band room after school was out. The
 crowds actually helped me to relax and play well because an
 impersonal audience can be easier to face than an intimate one. The
 only thing I regret is the wasted time composing on the MIDI.<br>
