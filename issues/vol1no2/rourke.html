 It seems strange to think of the <i>Lysistrata</i> as high art. Somehow,
 an audience in suit-and-tie and evening dresses leering over
 drawings of large <i>phalloi</i> and laughing nervously at mild
 obscenities just doesn't fit Aristophanes' decor. But at a recent
 performance of the <i>Lysistrata</i>, I saw how well a group of
 student performers and professional stage-technicians could bring
 together high art and low humor for a sold out museum audience.<br>
 <br>
 The performance was held at the Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum
 in Boston, the private museum located in the former home of Mrs.
 Gardner and featuring her stunning private collection, minus
 Rembrandt's <i>Storm on the Sea of Galilee</i> and the other paintings
 stolen in the spectacular 1991 theft. Like all musical and theatrical
 performances at the Gardner, <i>Lysistrata</i> was held in the second-
 floor hall, where the audience sits on movable chairs amidst glass
 cases of sketches and illuminated manuscripts, tapestries and old
 books. There was a small raised stage, with two or three step-
 levels, a bare altar at the front, and scatterings of <i>faux</i> columns
 and a cloth backdrop at the rear.<br>
 <br>
 The translation used was Nicholas Rudall's in the Elephant <i>Plays
 for Performance</i> series; Rudall is an editor of the series and
 translator of several plays of Ibsen. Fortunately (to my taste), the
 director (Art Shettle) did not allow himself to be led by the nose;
 many of Rudall's suggestions were dealt with gingerly or ignored.<br>
 <br>
 The most important of these changes are in the composition of the
 chorus and in the complexity of the music and choreography. The
 chorus is made up of <i>young</i> men and <i>younger</i> women. This
 was not merely dictated by the ages of the performers; for
 example, the actress playing Lysistrata herself (Winsome Brown)
 was an undergraduate at Harvard, but with her makeup and her
 fine performance, appeared to be in her thirties, as did the actor
 playing the Commissioner (Ian Lithgow) (of course, they may
 very well have been 'non-traditional students' and my eyesight not
 good enough to distinguish makeup from reality at a distance of
 fifteen rows, but that would illustrate my point equally well).
 Rather this seems to have been a deliberate decision on the part of
 the directors to use younger actors in the choruses.<br>
 <br>
 There was a purpose to this. The choruses were complex,
 involved, athletic, and utterly charming: the best was the parados
 (as is only fitting), in which smooth, featureless, handled Balinese
 masks (designed by Eric Bornstein) were manipulated as mask,
 sword, and even as a stand-in for the Attic <i>phalloi</i>; the moves
 were fluid and expressed an eroticism denied, the three female
 <i>choreutai</i> manipulating the three males with their moves by
 approaching and backing away, circling, and thus representing the
 women's frustration of the men, in both the sexual and political
 senses. The music (which was not original) was very carefully
 matched to the choreography, and the sparse costuming of the
 women <i>choreutai</i> set off by the ancient-military costuming of the
 males.<br>
 <br>
 The main problem was that the director didn't go all the way: lines
 like 'I'll break your neck, you aging Gramps' simply don't fit
 when the man in question is in his twenties or early thirties. The
 director shouldn't have spared the text <i>and</i> changed the cast.
 But, then again, we can't all be perfect.<br>
 <br>
 In general the acting ran from competent to talented. Best were
 Brown's Lysistrata, played as a sophisticate in a world of foolish
 young women, Lithgow's conservative crank of a Commissioner,
 and David L. McMahon's almost beer-guzzling Kinesias (whose
 friends, Rudall says, call him Humper, but whom I'd have called
 Buck). Myrrhine (Carolyn Forno) and Calonike (Esme Howard)
 were competently acted, as was Lampito (Deidre Sullivan), but for
 the one or two slips of her southern accent. All in all, first-rate
 performances for students.<br>
 <br>
 Bornstein's masks and Claire Mallardi's choreography, which
 made the show, deserve special recongition; Pieter Burgess'
 costumes were all well-done if not shockingly original, while the
 minimalist set, which accomodated the blocking, the
 choreography, and the entrances and exits well, was unpretentious
 if uninspired. All in all, a very encouraging performance by a
 number of very talented students. One hopes the Gardner will
 present more such shows in the future.<br>
