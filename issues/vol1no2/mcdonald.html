 This play is based on Euripides' <i>Bacchae</i> and concentrates on
 themes of possession, violence and transformation. Caryl
 Churchill reacts against the stereotype of the nonviolent female and
 claims that 'there is a danger of polarizing men and women into
 what becomes again the traditional view that men are naturally
 more violent and so have no reason to change.' She seems more
 interested in the way society tries to oppress and deform women
 than in their nature, issues more of gender than of sex. The parts
 of the women in this play seem particularly developed, and one can
 easily say this is typical of Churchill's oeuvre; here we find
 variations of <i>Top Girls</i>. There is even more interest here than in
 Euripides' play in how Dionysus affects women.<br>
 <br>
 David Lan, on the other hand, as a South African anthropologist
 with research conducted in Zimbabwe, was particularly interested
 in the phenomenon of possession. His earlier plays deal with
 imperialism, and the conflict between invading occupiers and
 indigenous occupied. Here, too, is the question of imperialism:
 Who is possessed by whom, and what does one take from the
 possessor?<br>
 <br>
 Churchill and Lan created <i>A Mouthful of Birds</i> for the Joint
 Stock Theatre Group in 1986. This was a group dedicated to
 maintaining originality and joint efforts of creation, besides
 offering an alternative to stereotypical riskless London fare. Les
 Waters, who was one of the original directors, also directed this
 production in La Jolla. It incorporates dance to convey nonverbal
 messages. The original choreography was by Ian Spink.<br>
 <br>
 The story is of seven people whose lives unfold in three sections:
 an introduction, an 'undefended' day, and the aftermath. Each of
 the characters in some ways performs 'mainstream' roles, but each
 shows an undercurrent of violence that is revealed during the
 'undefended' day. In the introduction people fit prescribed roles;
 by the end they become outsiders to fit themselves more than
 society. The idea of an undefended day is a time when the body
 can be possessed by a spirit, or indeed, it can be possessed by an
 addiction, a love, or intense desire.<br>
 <br>
 Lena is a mother who kills her own child to free herself from an
 oppressive husband. His banality is one of his most oppressive
 tools. His violence is revealed in freeway competition, and in
 dominating his wife. She thinks she will escape from a spirit that
 says negative things about her and her husband, if only she will
 kill her child. She kills the child, but is not free from the spirit. It is
 her permanent demon. We see her taking care of old people in the
 end, realizing her capacity to nurture or kill. Here we have
 Churchill and Lan showing us a woman in search of self, both a
 victim and perpetrator of violence. She is a mother and touches on
 fears of women as nurturers and destroyers, something we might
 call the Medea syndrome. This syndrome was well illustrated by
 Bob Wilson in his <i>Deafman Glance</i>, based on Euripides'
 <i>Medea</i>: a mother brings her child a glass of milk, and then kills
 him with a knife.<br>
 <br>
 Marcia is a receptionist, originally from Trinidad, who becomes a
 medium in her undefended day. She is possessed by Sybil (aptly
 named after her classical predecessor), a 'spirit from the white
 upper-middle classes,' but also acts as the conduit for a spirit
 called Baron Sunday. Marcia loses her power at the end and Sybil
 takes over. At the end she is on a boat and hopes she'll 'never
 wake to see the sky without a star.' This could be a paradigm of
 imperialism and the outsider. The white occupier takes over and
 the native is suppressed; she imitates the oppressor as she did in
 the introduction, taking on the 'imperial' accent. Finally she is
 released to a place on the ocean where she belongs and does not
 belong. She floats and adapts. She is the outsider who finds a
 place, but never a static one.<br>
 <br>
 Derek is unemployed, so he works out; his concern with the body
 is clear. He is possessed by Pentheus, and threatens violence
 against Dionysus. He is also possessed by Herculine Barbin, a
 French hermaphrodite from the nineteenth century. He experiences
 a sex change. He is also dismembered as Pentheus by Doreen who
 has become Agave. His transformation leads to daily satisfaction,
 the comfort of being 'in love with a lion-tamer from Kabul.'
 Contrary to the original Pentheus, who was dismembered and
 died, he has been dismembered to gain a body and live.<br>
 <br>
 Yvonne is an acupuncturist who is possessed by her addiction to
 alcohol. She becomes a butcher and couples her need for violence
 with a talent for identifying body parts. In the introductory episode
 we saw her violence when a patient of hers fell asleep, rather than
 paying attention to her ministrations. Perhaps the animal victim
 satisfies her drive for control, and the needle is well exchanged for
 a knife. She also escapes the gender stereotype saying, 'Many
 people are surprised to see a woman behind this counter.'<br>
 <br>
 Paul, a business man, falls in love with a pig he is not able to save
 from his own slaughterhouse. But when he rescues the 'corpse,'
 he peels off its wrapper, and it rises to dance with him. This is
 magic realism with charming kinkiness. At the end Paul is shown
 as alcoholic and waiting for a potential love. His fable has ended
 with loss; he has only dreams and continual possession by his
 addiction. Possession in this play can be good and bad.<br>
 <br>
 Dan, a minister, is another of the ambivalent characters. When he
 is arrested the police cannot tell whether he is male or female. He
 dances people to death, choreographing for them their private joy.
 He is a serial killer using pleasure as his murder weapon. (Could
 this be some veiled commentary on organized religion?) For a
 while, Dan is aptly Dionysus. At the end we see him with his
 garden. He talks about it being green now, whereas barren before.
 Earlier a prison guard seems to be quoting a confession: 'My plan
 was that they should all be good deaths...To die of pleasure, like a
 young boy slipping through the mirror of a mountain stream [i.e.,
 Narcissus?]. These are the deaths the earth needs to grow strong.'
 By the end, Dan's garden is growing very well.<br>
 <br>
 Doreen is a secretary who is known for escaping the mundane: she
 spent a night sleeping on the grass by a canal. In her undefended
 day she slashes a neighbor's face. She is possessed by the spirit of
 Agave, and willingly dismembers Pentheus. At one point she
 develops telekinesis, able to make objects fly and bounce a person
 off walls. She is still seething with restlessness at the end. She is
 the one for whom the play was named, 'It seems that my mouth is
 full of birds which I crunch between my teeth. Their feathers, their
 blood and broken bones are choking me. I carry on my work as a
 secretary.' She has accepted herself, but she is restless for
 expression. This is the secretary from hell.<br>
 <br>
 The play begins and ends with a dance performed by Dionysus. It
 is a dance that seduces the audience into a sensual experience.
 There are other dances, for instance the Fruit Ballet, in which
 imaginary fruit is wrenched apart and consumed. We saw Dan
 dance people to death. Dionysus 1 and Dionysus 2 clothe
 Pentheus, preparing him for a sacrifice, and dance a preview of his
 ecstatic death. Pentheus, as a priest, has his robes put on him, but
 in this case he will be the sacrificial victim rather than the
 sacrificing priest. The pig also dances with Paul. There is another
 dance called 'Extreme Happiness.' The day of possession ends in
 ecstasy.<br>
 <br>
 Good actors and actresses are essential for this play, and the La
 Jolla production had them. David Barrera was haunting as Dan,
 also as a spirit, and as Dionysus. His dance had insinuating charm.
 Adrianne Krstansky as Doreen and Agave brought a seething
 unpredictable violence to her performance. Meg MacCary as
 Yvonne had a steely undertone to her voice that sliced the audience
 like the needles of the acupuncturist or the knife she used as a
 butcher. Sevanne Kassarjian as Lena was a convincing mother and
 murderess, combining the benign with the dangerous in her
 performance.<br>
 <br>
 Where does this production depart from Euripides' <i>Bacchae</i>?
 Obviously these are different stories. In <i>A Mouthful of Birds</i>
 there is also fulfillment in most of the transformations, whereas the
 end of the <i>Bacchae</i> is tragic. In the modern play the main
 tragedy is the businessman's, an apt Marxist aside. It is no
 accident that a pig is his love (pigs were sacred to Aphrodite in
 ancient Greece, and perhaps Churchill/Lan used the pig with this
 resonance in mind). There is also the element of the absurd in
 <i>Mouthful</i>. One is reminded of Ionesco, perhaps Genet, and at
 times we observe Beckett's bleak humor. Pinter also comes to
 mind in the various ritual transformations.<br>
 <br>
 Churchill's women are allowed to be violent, and use their
 violence for fulfilling professional lives. Men can be women, and
 women men. Dionysus is a facilitator for self-discovery. The
 psychological lines are clear, whereas Euripides was telling us that
 story, and a story very much about the abuse of power. The
 ancient poet concentrated more on plot than character, although the
 plot certainly revealed character. Pentheus, refusing to recognize
 the god in the city, and himself, is violently punished. In <i>A
 Mouthful of Birds</i> the characters go through violence as if it were
 a tunnel for self-discovery. We see options facilitated. Doors are
 opened rather than closed; Euripides' Dionysus slammed the doors
 on Pentheus, Agave and her father Cadmus (a character who does
 not appear in Mouthful of Birds). The <i>Bacchae</i> has been
 simplified and used as a parable in the midst of terrifying Aesopean
 fables. The supernatural elements are more a feature of
 <i>Mouthful</i>, and there are more elements of the absurd (a pig
 coming to life and dancing).<br>
 <br>
 There is an obvious reference to Nietzsche's concept of Apollo and
 Dionysus in <i>The Birth of Tragedy</i>, as an essential component
 for understanding hidden reality. Nietzsche followed his title with
 'Out of the Spirit of Music,' realizing how music was Apollo's
 particular vehicle. Apollo links with Dionysus, and in Mouthful of
 Birds uses music with dance to convey Dionysus' violent and
 seductive power, the god who is most fierce (<i>deinotatos</i>) and
 also most mild (<i>epiotatos</i> <i>Bacchae</i> 861).<br>
 <br>
 Both the world of <i>Mouthful of Birds</i> and the world of the
 <i>Bacchae</i> seem stable at the beginning. They are undone by the
 visitation of Dionysus in his various forms. In the <i>Bacchae</i>
 specific victims were chosen. In the Churchill/Lan play, no one is
 immune. This is particularly clear in the case of Marcia. Did she
 put on his knowledge and his power before the indifferent beak
 could let her drop? In both plays we have the theme of gender
 fluidity: Dionysus is mocked by Pentheus for his feminine
 qualities, but Pentheus is transformed by Dionysus at the end of
 the play into the female role he mocked. In <i>Mouthful of Birds</i> a
 physical operation secures the transformation. Feminine qualities
 in a man are not mocked in the obvious way they were in the
 <i>Bacchae</i>, and the transformation is fulfilling rather than a
 tragedy.<br>
 <br>
 Churchill, rather than extending Euripides' analysis of the
 difference between men and women, collapses both into one
 general category: men and women alike have potential for violence;
 society normally represses it; when it breaks out they learn about
 themselves; then they have to apply their own peculiar controls, or
 channel it into satisfying functions. Churchill brilliantly achieves
 the recognition for her characters which Aristotle demands of great
 tragedy: they suffer a change of fortune (peripeteia) through their
 lapse into violence but thereby they learn who they are
 (anagnorisis).<br>
 <br>
 The <i>Bacchae</i> follows Aristotelian rules of closure; it has an end.
 <i>A Mouthful of Birds</i> does not end, although it has precise form;
 it provides a new beginning. Dionysus began and ended with a
 dance which goes on for eternity; the structure is circular. The
 older play shows us death and reminds us of our mortality; the
 new one implies endless possibilities in life.
 It is primarily a parable about women and violence, women and
 their escapes, women and self-discovery. Agave the tragic victim
 becomes Agave the sorceress.<br>
 <br>
 One might say that the two plays show the two aspects of
 Dionysus, one in his primarily negative form (<i>Bacchae</i>) and the
 other in his positive (<i>Mouthful of Birds</i>). In the former he is
 more destructive than creative; in the latter he is the source of
 creation for mankind. In both we see the god at work. In the latter
 we see him dance and we join him in spirit. In a successful
 performance, like this one, Dan's dance is performed for us. We
 die unto Dionysus so that we may live.<br>
