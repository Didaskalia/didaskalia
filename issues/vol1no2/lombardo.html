 After an encouraging start at the 1993 meeting of the Classical
 Association of the Middle West and South, we decided to go ahead
 with a second installment of Open Mike for Rhapsodes at the 1994
 meeting in Atlanta. About forty people attended the session
 (scheduled in the last time slot of the meeting), with ten
 participants reading/performing selections up to fifteen minutes in
 length of Greek, Latin, or original translation. Pamela Gordon
 presided, setting a friendly, informal tone and encouraging
 everyone to help themselves to the wine and cheese provided.<br>
 <br>
 Authors represented included Homer, Hesiod, Sappho,
 Mimnermus, Terence, Catullus, Vergil, Ovid, and Lucan. Four
 new translations were featured: Jane Joyce's <i>Pharsalia</i> (part of
 the Erictho scene, horrifically read in English and Latin by Pamela
 Gordon); Deena Berg's <i>Adelphi</i> (the first scene between the two
 fathers, played by David Armstrong and Gareth Morgan); Betty
 Rose Nagle's <i>Fasti</i> (three limpid catasterisms, read by the
 translator): and Stanley Lombardo's <i>Theogony</i> (the opening and
 castration of Ouranos, recited by the translator in straw hat and
 staff).<br>
 <br>
 There were two musical performances: Bert Steiner sang two
 original Modern Greek songs, and Paula Reiner sang Sappho in
 English and Greek with guitar accompaniment. Dan Levine read
 three Mimnermus poems in Greek. Pauline Nugent did a Dido
 speech from the <i>Aeneid</i> in Latin, and joined Gareth Morgan in a
 Greek rendition of the Hector and Andromache scene from <i>Iliad</i>
 6. David Fredrick performed Catullus 63, the Atthis poem, with a
 fine sense of the ithyphallic rhythm and a nice falsetto in the
 middle.<br>
 <br>
 The climax was Gareth Morgan reading the end of the <i>Iliad</i> in
 Greek. As Dan Levine remarked afterwards, when Gareth reads
 something, it stays read. This is now the forty-somethingth
 consecutive semester Gareth has been reading Latin and Greek out
 loud during every noon hour with his students and colleagues at
 Texas. It shows.<br>
 <br>
 The Open Mike was a huge success in promoting the dramatic
 reading of mostly non-dramatic classical literature: epic, elegiac,
 and lyric as it turned out. We would like to hear some prose as
 well next time, an epideictic speech maybe (we keep inviting
 sophists in our announcement, but they must be going elsewhere),
 a passage of Apuleius, some Plato or Cicero, whatever. We are
 hoping that CAMWS will make Open Mike for Rhapsodes a
 regular event at the annual meeting. Next year in Omaha.<br>
