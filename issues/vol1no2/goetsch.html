 An annual general meeting, of course, is not a conference on
 theatrical performance. But the program of the 90th AGM of the
 British Classical Association was in fact weighted heavily toward
 dramatic production. This was thanks in great part to the efforts of
 David Wiles, who assembled a 7-paper panel on theatrical space
 which lasted all day Tuesday.<br>
 <br>
 Leslie Read of Exeter ('The Fifth-Century Orchestra: Staging
 Assumptions in the 'Rectilinear or Circular' Debate') started off the
 proceedings by reexamining the evidence in light of our own
 proscenium-haunted preconceptions. His conclusion was that
 theaters in the 5th and 4th centuries BCE had no single canonical
 shape, and that deme theaters particularly varied a good deal in
 construction. This led to a good deal of speculation on the logistics
 of touring the demes, a more concrete version of which Read has
 promised us for Issue 5.<br>
 <br>
 Rush Rehm of Stanford ('Spatial Transformation in Tragedy: The
 Ritual Catalyst') distinguished theatrical, scenic, extrascenic,
 extratheatrical, and metatheatrical space and argued that the
 transformative liminality of ritual exists within and across them. By
 evoking rituals the Athenian poets manipulated the empty space of
 their stage, taking the Theater of Dionysus from public to private,
 general to specific, past to present.<br>
 <br>
 David Wiles of Royal Holloway ('Did Euripides Betray his
 Inexperience at <i>Alkestis</i> 860-1?') discussed a new polarity in
 Greek theatrical practice: the opposition of left and right, east and
 west, and made a convincing case for the western, stage-left
 <i>eisodos</i> of the Theater of Dionysus as the entrance from which
 salvation came, whereas the eastern, stage-right <i>eisodos</i> led to
 stagnation and destruction.<br>
 <br>
 Lowell Edmunds of Rutgers ('Diegetic Space in Greek Tragedy')
 used Sophocles' <i>OC</i> to illustrate the non-mimetic nature of space
 offstage. Because the audience cannot see that space even in a
 symbolic representation, the actors must create it for them out of
 words, just as Antigone creates the world for her blind father by
 describing it. Wiles contested Edmunds' assertion that diegetic
 space is &quot;prior&quot;, arguing that it is created not from nothing but from
 the mythological, social and artistic context of the production.<br>
 <br>
 Suzanne Said of Columbia ('Tragic Space Among the Barbarians')
 treated a specific example of Rehm's extratheatrical space which
 was also at times diegetic space. The happy Greece which
 Iphigenia tries to conjure in Euripides' <i>IT</i> proves to be a fragile
 illusion; in actuality, the poet's discourse constructs Hellenic
 territory as barbarous by its parallels with the harsh land of Tauris.<br>
 <br>
 Nick Lowe of Royal Holloway ('Comic Houses') characterized the
 plots of New Comedy, as mapped onto the 4th-century stage, as
 'Houses having sex with one another:' <i>oikoi</i> conspiring to
 perpetuate themselves by socially approved citizen marriage. The
 innovation in stage practice of a three-door <i>skene</i> therefore
 reflects the shift in Athenian political focus at the end of the 5th
 century.<br>
 <br>
 Sallie Goetsch of the University of Michigan ('Staging and the Date
 of <i>Prometheus Bound</i>'), argued that the production problems of
 <i>Prometheus</i> are best overcome by use of mimetic dance.<br>
 <br>
 Three further papers deserve mention, though they did not address
 problems of staging specifically. Keith Sidwell of St. Patrick's
 College, Maynooth, made a case for 'para-comedy', the parody of
 characters and scenes from plays by rival poets, in his
 'Aristophanes and his Rivals.' Alison Sharrock came from the
 University of Keele to convince us that the <i>really</i> clever thing
 about Plautus' Pseudolus is that he can deceive the audience into
 thinking he has a plan ('A Sense of Superiority: Deceiving the
 Audience in Roman Comedy'). And Richard Seaford of Exeter
 explained Ajax's 'deception speech' in terms of mystery cults, an
 interpretation valuable for any actor who has to undertake the part
 ('Sophokles and the Mysteries').<br>
 <br>
 On the evening of April 5, Peter Wiseman and Mary Beard staged a
 debate about performance possibilites in Rome, with Wiseman
 arguing in favor of the quasi-dramatic performance of hymns and
 other works at religious and private festivals.<br>
 <br>
 On the evening of April 6, the Exeter drama department presented
 <i>Attis: A Performance of Catullus 63</i> in the Roborough studio
 theater. The production was the weightiest piece of evidence which
 Wiseman could have brought to bear, a powerful argument that
 hymns like Catullus 63 can be and indeed should be performed,
 whether or not they were in antiquity.<br>
 <br>
 Inspired by Peter Wiseman and directed by Les Read of the drama
 department, <i>Attis</i> featured 36 drama students, four masks, and
 musical instruments appropriate to Cybele's rites: an oboe, drums,
 cymbals, and even a pair of homemade bullroarers. The masks
 were quite beautiful: Cybele in silver with gilded crown and
 corkscrew curls; her lion in gold with tawny mane; Attis pale in a
 red Phrygian cap; and a maenad with wild hair of twine and ivy
 crown.<br>
 <br>
 The masks were the province of a single actor. In the first, Latin
 half of the performance, the chorus processed in, led by the eerie,
 Eastern wails of the oboe, to form rows facing the audience. Men
 and women alike wore plain blue, green, and brown tunics
 reaching slightly below their knees. Flickering red light played over
 them in the dimness, creating a powerful aura of mystery--in the
 ritual sense, that is.<br>
 <br>
 As they began to sing Latin galliambics, passing the words from
 high to low voices through a quite beautiful harmony, the actor
 stepped forward and donned the mask of Attis. He then embarked
 on a vivid pantomime illustrating Catullus' hymn, gestures fluid
 and precise, kneeling in a red pin-spot for the castration, holding
 the maenad's mask up to dance through the woods in company,
 falling in his exhaustion. At the waking and realization, he lifted the
 Attis mask from an agonized face and assumed the mask and stance
 of Cybele calling her wayward lover back. Finally he embodied the
 lion itself, chasing Attis, and disappeared back into the chorus of
 worshippers, who then exited as the lights went down.<br>
 <br>
 Up came white lights to reveal Publius Clodius Pulcher in a
 tuxedo, explaining about the Megalensian Games, Catullus'
 authorship of the hymn, and the prohibition against Roman citizens
 becoming Galli. The chorus then embarked, in more natural
 lighting, on a repetition of the hymn in English, including whirling
 processions around a painted design on the floor and further
 enactment, shared as were the lines, of the adventures of Attis. A
 single sweep of a glittering sickle sufficed for the castration--a
 remarkably tasteful and effective handling of a difficult staging
 problem. Cybele was portrayed by a woman enthroned with robe
 and crown, and her lion was our original actor in copper lame
 trousers, dancing bare-chested and long-haired.<br>
 <br>
 'Drive others insane,' the hymn concluded, followed by a
 blackout. The ambivalence of Catullus' poem was clear; the
 imagination of the director and the talent of the performers even
 clearer.<br>
