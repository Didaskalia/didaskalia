  <p> <i>Didaskalia</i> as video-resource clearing-house Videos</p>
  <p> If you're not in a position to attend performances of Greek tragedy regularly, they can be the only way of gaining a sense of the posssibilities offered by the Greek stage. Ideally one needs a selection of different staged versions to compare and contrast different ways of handling ancient drama. Why not have <i>Didaskalia</i> act as a clearing house, even a distribution point for available versions? It would save those of us who live in isolated regions (try inland Australia) hours of time spent hunting down catalogues and writing often-unanswered letters. </p>
