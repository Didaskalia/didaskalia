 The Jean Cocteau repertory has been around since 1971 (since
 1974 in their current theater), each season performing several
 plays in tandem throughout the week; hence the odd array of
 performance dates given above. Craig Smith (Agamemnon) has
 been with the company for 21 years and is clearly the most
 accomplished of the cast; Christopher Black (Old Man) is in his
 first season and equally clearly the least accomplished, although
 not to such a point that he could spoil what was on the whole a
 better than average off-off Broadway production of a Greek play.
 (I note that among the donors supporting the company are Prof.
 and Mrs. Lionel Casson.)<br>
 <br>
 Two recurrent problems in putting on Greek tragedies --how to
 handle to chorus and how to convey the proper level of tragic
 sensibility -- were met with differing levels of success. The
 chorus were only three in number, who for the most part spoke as
 individuals, only occasionally together. This is probably the best
 way to bring the words of the ancient chorus to the modern stage,
 especially when it is as small as that of the Bouwerie Lane <br>
 theater.<br>
 The recurrent practical problem is that most modern actors (it
 would seem) are not trained to speak in chorus, nor do modern
 directors know what to do with such an odd body during the
 course of a play. Too many voices chanting together wind up
 droning -- a deadly, or more accurately soporific, reading of lines
 several times removed from the reality of the original
 performance. Having the chorus speak as individuals, moreover,
 allows modern productions to avoid having the chorus address
 either nobody in particular (unless a deity is named) or the
 audience. Neither is a convention impossible for audiences today
 to accomodate, but since modern productions usually aim towards
 a naturalistic delivery, it suits them to have one chorus member
 address the others. In this, the three members of the <i>IA</i> chorus
 did quite well.<br>
 <br>
 The Merwin-Dimock translation, which is both poetic and actable,
 helped them, as it did the rest of the cast. Occasionally, however,
 the tragic diction of the translation fought against the naturalistic
 level Adamson wanted. Even Smith had his problems with this;
 Black and Kennedy Brown (Messenger) were frequently off the
 mark, achieving bathos more than pathos. <br>
 <br>
 Dressing the actors is another standard problem for modern
 productions of Greek tragedy, and this one did not overcome it.
 The costume designer, Steven F. Graver, cannot be faulted for
 wanting to provide more up-to-date garments than those worn in
 ancient Athens, but he failed to achieve a clear or unified sense of
 any particular time or place. The chorus of three young women
 looked as though they had just walked in off the street on their
 way from the East Village to Soho. The soldiers were in generic
 military fatigues and army boots. Clytemnestra arrived from
 Mycenae dressed in a brightly colored dress, somewhat
 suggestive of African styles, an impression augmented by the fact
 that Adrienne Williams is in fact an African American. There was
 nothing in all this costuming that an audience could not adjust to,
 but it was more jarring than necessary.<br>
 <br>
 The night I attended the play, the actors returned to the stage to
 answer questions from the audience. They, at least those who
 chose to answer, had done their homework, and made no gaffes
 that a classically trained pedant could scoff at.<br>
