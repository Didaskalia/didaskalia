 The question of what constitutes performance has yet to be
 answered. With a little ingenuity, almost any activity can be
 construed as performance. But it by no means requires the talents
 of a sophist to demonstrate that performance was much more
 common in antiquity than it is in the study of antiquity. Most of
 Greek literature, and not a little of Latin, was presented to its
 original audience as a performance. Add to that the performing arts
 which we know existed but which made use of no written text,
 such as Atellan farce and pantomime, and a picture emerges of a
 world much more 'theatrical' than a collection of Oxford Classical
 Texts would ever suggest.<br>
 <br>
 In moving 'Beyond Spoken Drama,' the editors of <i>Didaskalia</i>
 have attempted to bring the performance aspect of genres other than
 comedy, tragedy, and satyr-play, and the non-dialogue aspects of
 drama, to the forefront. Issue 2's features include a
 composer/music director's retrospective on music for Roman
 comedy, a description of the life and art of a pantomime, synopses
 of several lectures on offstage theatricality, and a testimony that
 oral recitation of ancient poetry is alive and well among the
 members of CAMWS. Also worthy of note in this context are
 Steven Lonsdale's <i>Dance and Ritual Play in Greek Religion</i> and
 the performance of Catullus 63--with a cast of 30--which took
 place at the Classical Association in Exeter. The International
 Society for the Study of Greek and Roman Music is flourishing
 and beginning to bring the research projects of its members to our
 attention.<br>
 <br>
 We hope that the projects described in this issue will encourage
 others to try putting less traditional material onto the stage. Not
 only would such ventures engage the attention of students, they
 would force us, as scholars, to approach texts from a different
 perspective. Performance criticism has made a tremendous
 difference to our understanding of drama; it might similarly affect
 our understanding of other forms of poetry. And, as the Exeter
 Catullus production shows, 'non-dramatic' poetry is viable and
 interesting when staged. Even though we have very little evidence
 of the forms of the original spectacles, we usually have enough
 testimony to lead us to creative cultural borrowings. The Seraikella
 Chau of India, for instance, is noted for many of the same qualities
 which distinguished Greco-Roman pantomime. If a work resonates
 for us in printed form, will it not be even more effective on its feet?<br>
 <br>
 That issue is one which we will take up again, in a slightly different
 way, in Issue 3 at the beginning of August. The question there is
 what makes a translation into a script, and several translators will
 provide their answers and samples of their work.<br>
 <br>
 We have included a new section, the Suggestion Box, so
 subscribers can tell us where they'd like to see <i>Didaskalia</i>
 heading in the future. As always, listings and reviews will be
 welcome, as are responses to anything published in previous
 issues. Guidelines for contributors may be found at the end of this
 issue.<br>
