 <p>From March 9-14,  2004, the Lehman College Theatre Program presented Sophocles' <i>Antigone</i>,  directed by Professor Susan Watson Turner, in the Lovinger Theatre.  Adapted from a translation by Mark Falstein, Lehman College's production  of <i>Antigone</i> featured a cast of students and alumni in an innovative,  contemporized production of this classic tragedy. In this article,  I will discuss how in her interpretation of <i>Antigone</i> Watson  Turner made Sophocles' fifth-century BC tragedy accessible to a twenty-first  century Bronx audience. </p>

 <p>While researching  this paper, I observed Watson Turner's <i>Antigone</i> rehearsals,  recorded my observations and also wrote a <a href="doylestudyg.htm">study  guide</a> for local high school audiences, posted on our department's  web page and including an interview with the director. As I prepared  this article for publication, I identified the key elements of her  directorial concept: a reshaping of the play's choral and narrative  elements; an emphasis upon such kinesthetic elements as music, sound,  choreography and costuming; and an onstage enactment of the traditional  offstage violence by utilizing contemporary set and lighting design  choices.</p>
 <p>I also explored  reviews of other New York City productions of <i>Antigone</i> in order  to place Watson Turner&#8217;s production in a wider context vis-&agrave;-vis  trends in contemporary performance of ancient drama. Every year, it  seems, <i>Antigone</i> graces a New York stage, and, as Margo Jefferson  commented in her review of the May 2004 production at La MaMa, &#8220;It  is considered <em>de rigueur</em> now for writers and directors to  play freely with the classics.&#8221; (Jefferson 2004, E3) This certainly  applies to <i>Antigone</i>, for reviews of the following productions  suggest this directorial experimentation often leads to mixed results.  For instance, director Richard S. Bach, in his New York International  Fringe Festival production of <i>Antigone</i> <em>Through Time</em>,  set the play &#8220;not in ancient Greece&#8230; but in the 1940s  on a Greek island, where some 3,000 women have been placed in an internment  camp.&#8221; (Gates 1998, B15) The women, part of the Resistance to  the German occupation of Greece, have refused to sign a declaration  of repentance and early in the play are shot by a firing squad, only  to transform into characters in Sophocles&#8217; <i>Antigone</i>.  In the Women&#8217;s Project&#8217;s <i>Antigone</i> Project, five  female writers and five female directors deconstructed Sophocles&#8217;  play, offering a &#8220;Rashomon-ized view of (Antigone&#8217;s) tragic  plight.&#8221; (Hoban 2004, E5) While the production was engaging  and funny, for the <em><em>New York Times </em></em>reviewer at least,  the &#8220;snappy deconstructionist approach to the classic&#8217;s  central themes ends up diluting them; it is a seductive dim sum rather  than a satisfying meal.&#8221; (Bruckner 1995, 19)</p>

 <p>Pearl Theatre  Company artistic director Shepard Sobel&#8217;s November 1995 <i>Antigone</i>  substituted Eurydice for the chorus: &#8220;since there is no one  for Creon to argue with about his ideas of strong kingly government,&#8221;  D. J. R. Bruckner observed, &#8220;he can only address the audience  directly, and the running commentary of Eurydice-as-chorus begins  to sound like a string of asides, not a warning that his confidence  and stubbornness will bring disaster.&#8221; (Bruckner 1995, 19) Finally,  in the National Asian American Theater Company&#8217;s production  of <i>Antigone</i> in July 2004, director Jean Randich cast Mia Katigbak,  the company&#8217;s producing director, in the role of Creon. Reviewing  this production of <i>Antigone</i> for the <em>New York Times </em>,  Bruckner observed that &#8220;whenever Ms. Katigbak is on a stage  she owns it, and she makes a formidable male ruler who inherits not  only a throne, but authority over the violent, bloodied and doomed  remnants of the family Oedipus left behind.&#8221; (Bruckner 2004,  E27)</p>

 <p>In comparison,  Watson Turner approached <i>Antigone</i> as an examination of the  role of leadership in an authoritarian society, a compelling theme  for Americans in the 2004 presidential election year. The following  statement encapsulated her directorial approach: &#8220;When leaders  act contrary to conscience, we must act contrary to leaders.&#8221;  I reproduce here a substantial quotation from my interview with her  in February 2004: </p>

  <blockquote> 

  <p>The inequities we watch today (via TV, newspapers and the Internet) are in some cases parallel to the actions of Creon. What do we do as individuals&#8212;as citizens, as artists, as teachers&#8212;to encourage action against what we know and understand to be unjust behavior?</p>

  <p>My own response to being assigned to direct <i>Antigone</i> was not unlike a contemporary student's reaction to Greek drama. As much as I love directing for the theatre, the thought of preparing <i>Antigone</i> for contemporary artists and audiences presented a new challenge for me as a director. How could I adapt this centuries-old tragedy to ring true and make it provocative for a contemporary audience and examine the role of leadership in American society?</p>
  <p>In my preproduction research I found that <i>Antigone</i> has been interpreted and approached from several different perspectives, and I read many different translations. The most interesting translation surfaced through an audio reading adapted by Michael Falstein. Falstein's adaptation geared the reader/listener toward a more ancient aural appreciation of the play.</p>

  <p>This audio version used a narrator to bridge the gaps in the story, provided references for Greek language and Greek mythology, and, through these elements, unfolded the story more clearly and powerfully. My task as director then became one of translating the excitement and enthusiasm I felt by listening to this audio recording to the stage. By infusing the choral odes with dance my objective was to provide the audience with a visualization of Sophocles&#8217; intention. (Watson Turner, 2004a)</p>
  
  </blockquote>

 <p>Taking her cue  from Falstein's adaptation, Watson Turner reshaped the traditional  narrative and choral elements of <i>Antigone</i>. This included introducing  the &#8220;Storyteller,&#8221; a role which set the production within  a narrative and contextual framework for a contemporary audience.  She also divided Sophocles' chorus into the King Creon Chorus and  the People's Chorus, based upon economics, social status and physicality.  Reflected in their body language, gesture, costuming and dramatic  function, the King Creon Chorus was distinguished, learned, poised,  and they reluctantly offered Creon advice, which he failed to heed.  The People's Chorus, on the other hand, was more plebeian in their  body language, behavior, costuming and dramatic function.</p>

 <p>Throughout the  production, Watson Turner mingled the People's Chorus with the audience  in the auditorium, thereby establishing a connection between the spectators  and the action of the play. As the People's Chorus observed the unfolding  action, they pleaded with Creon on <i>Antigone</i>'s behalf and encouraged  the audience to join them. When the chorus moved onto the stage, the  audience's energy and focus followed the chorus, disintegrating the  &#8220;fourth wall&#8221; and engaging the audience to join the chorus  to plead for <i>Antigone</i>'s life.</p>
 <p>Watson Turner  also reconstituted the play's choral-episodic structure, introducing  choral dance sequences and enacting events normally narrated in the  play's choral odes. For instance, Watson Turner introduced a dance  sequence, a pre-parados before the prologos, which was underscored  with composer Richard V. Turner's riveting score. This pre-parados  featured the chorus members in identical translucent plastic masks  rising up from the Lovinger Theatre's hydraulic orchestra pit in a  haze of fog, presenting an image of Thebes as an uninhabitable land  suffering from environmental abuse. </p>

 <p>Later, as the  Storyteller narrated the battle between Polynices and Eteocles, six  actors with long wooden dowels enacted the battle in a stylized fight  sequence choreographed by Dyane Harvey. </p>

 <p>At battle's end,  both Polynices and Eteocles were killed, Polynices was rolled onto  the orchestra pit, and Eteocles was lifted and carried off stage.  The female chorus members sang and danced a hymn of praise to Dionysos  in celebration of the victory. This dithyramb then segued into a &#8220;Dionysian  ballet&#8221;, or victory celebration-dance, scored to a Latin-Caribbean  tempo, culminating in a magic trick.</p>
 <p>African, Latin  and Caribbean rhythm influenced the musical score, along with such  natural sounds as crashing waves, a receding tide, the calls of sea  birds, thunder and lightning as well as plucked strings. Sound effects  also shook the stage and toppled the elements in full surround sound.  Susan Soetaert's costume design represented the lines and style of  ancient Greek fashion with contemporary construction and fabric. The  costumes, reflecting the director's concern with staying within the  Greek frame, brought contemporary hints of fashion to the production's  overall visual design and aided a twenty-first century audience's  understanding of the play.</p>
 <p>Richard Ellis'  set design for <i>Antigone</i> employed architectural elements of  the classical Greek theatre adapted to the Lovinger Theatre, a 500-seat  proscenium theatre, with a steeply raked auditorium and stage-level  <em>vomitoria</em>. Upon initial examination, the set resembled the  <em>skene</em> of the ancient Greek theatre framed by columns at the  curtain line rendered to show a structural decay echoing the decay  in Creon's Thebes. While a significant portion of the action occurred  on the Lovinger's forestage, action also occurred on a raised three-foot  platform, reached by steps, which was bisected with a portal, in itself  divided by the two columns. Sliding walls on wagons, resembling <em>pinakes</em>,  were drawn on or offstage, creating either a solid wall or up to three  upstage entrances. Upstage of the portal was another playing space  that was separated from the downstage playing space by a black scrim.</p>

 <p>In this upstage  space, Watson Turner choreographed the deaths of <i>Antigone</i>,  Haemon and Eurydice in slow motion suffused with blood-red light.  </p>

 <p>Watson Turner  commented on this obvious departure from staging traditional productions  of Greek tragedy:</p>
  <blockquote> 
  I  elaborated upon Falstein's adaptation to portray <i>Antigone</i>'s  hanging, Haemon's suicide, as well as Eurydice's self-destruction,  in order to tragically illustrate the consequences of Creon's abuse  of power. By our illustrating rather than narrating these events on  stage, we can force a contemporary audience to participate fully in  and feel the tragedy. My goal was to have the audience members experience  this pain and share in the responsibility. The chorus, by failing  to speak out or by speaking out too late, was as guilty as Creon.  (Watson Turner 2004a)
</blockquote>
 <p>As Creon stood  alone onstage, his hands dripping in blood, Lehman College's <i>Antigone</i>  ended with Ken Ross's slide show presentation of photos of Hitler,  Stalin, Idi Amin, Rafael Trujillo and Saddam Hussein, underscoring  the link between these modern or contemporary authoritarian dictators  and Creon himself.</p>

 <p>Watson Turner  accomplished a potent examination of the role of leadership in an  authoritarian society. Lehman students who attended the production  commented on the multiracial casting, the interaction between the  chorus and the audience and the hard-hitting visual display of leaders  gone astray. The most poignant comment provided by an audience member  dealt with the clarity provided by this production to Sophocles&#8217;  story. Watson Turner, perhaps echoing her earlier observation about  the chorus&#8217;s failure to speak out, remarked, &#8220;One patron,  not a student, approached me to say that she understood now that silence  is not always golden.&#8221; (Watson Turner 2004b)</p>
