<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>For a contemporary  audience about to encounter Sophocles' <i>Antigone</i> in the theatre  for the first time, hundreds of questions are bound to come up. Where  did the stories for the Greek tragedies come from? How and why did  theatre begin in ancient Athens? Why was tragedy so important to the  Greeks? And many more questions. This study guide has been designed  to answer some of your questions and shed some light and meaning about  ancient Greek culture and its vibrant theatre that we still experience  and enjoy today.</p>
<p>It also features  an interview with Professor Susan Watson Turner, the director of the  Lehman College Theatre Program's production of <i>Antigone</i>, which  will be produced in the Lovinger Theatre on March 10-14, 2004. In  the interview, Professor Turner will discuss her unique approach to  directing this timeless classic.</p>
<p>The study guide  concludes with a brief synopsis of the action occurring before <i>Antigone</i> begins and a list of questions for classroom discussion.</p>
<h2>The Study Guide</h2>
<p><strong>Where  did the stories for these Greek tragedies come from?</strong><br>
 Ancient Greek civilization is usually divided into two time periods  or cultures, the Helladic Culture and the Hellenic Culture. The Helladic  Culture (ca. 1200-750 BC) developed in Mycenae on the Greek mainland  and in Troy in Asia Minor near the Hellespont in what is now Turkey.  When we think of Troy, many of us may be familiar with the Trojan  War (1184-1174 BC) because we know the story or the myth of the Trojan  Horse, a giant wooden horse that the Greeks used to defeat the Trojans.  Assuming it was a gift from the gods for their victory over the Greeks,  the Trojans pulled the horse through the gates of Troy and then celebrated  their victory with wine, while the Greek soldiers waited inside the  horse. While the Trojans slept off their victory celebration, the  Greeks emerged from the hiding place and defeated the Trojans.</p>
<p>What we might  not know, however, is that these stories about Helen and Paris, Agamemnon  and Clytemnestra were chronicled in Homer's <em>Iliad </em>and <em>Odyssey</em> and provided the source materials--the myths and legends--for the  plays later written by Aeschylus, Euripides, and Sophocles, the three  great ancient tragic playwrights. The average Athenian citizen was  familiar with these stories and myths, just as he or she would be  familiar with the myths of Oedipus, <i>Antigone</i> and Creon. In  the plays of the great tragic playwrights, furthermore, these myths  illustrate moral principles by which to live or to provide rational  explanations for irrational human urges.</p>
<p><strong>But how  and why did the theatre begin in ancient Athens?</strong><br>
 During the Hellenic Culture (750-31 BC), the second Greek culture,  the major political unit was the <em>polis</em>, a city-state composed  of a city and its surrounding countryside. Athens--along with Sparta,  Corinth and Thebes--was one of the most important and powerful Greek  city-states. Around 500 BC, over 2500 years ago, two historical developments  led to Athens' becoming the most important Greek city-state. First  the Persian War pitted the Greeks against the Persians. While Athens  was the artistic and commercial center of Greece, Sparta was the major  military power. When the Persian army defeated the Spartans, things  looked desperate for the Greeks until the Athenian navy defeated the  Persian navy. At about the same time, Athens became the world's first  democracy and, led by Pericles, entered the Periclean Age, a time  when the Parthenon, the Theatre of Dionysus and other civic buildings  were constructed. Flush with a strong sense of civic pride, then,  the Periclean Age ushered in a Golden Age of Drama. During a one hundred-year  time span (500-404 BC)--until Athens lost its predominance in the  Peloponnesian War--the three great playwrights along with other writers  competed in the writing of the best tragic trilogy of plays at the  City Dionysia.</p>
<p><strong>What does  the word &quot;tragedy&quot; mean?</strong><br>
 The source for the word &quot;tragedy&quot; is the Greek <i>tragedois</i>,  or &quot;goat song.&quot; Theatre historians don't know for certain,  but they suspect that either the Greeks initially sacrificed a goat  to Dionysus or gave it to the winning playwright as a prize for the  best tragic trilogy. Tragedy itself originates from the <i>dithyramb</i>,  a hymn or lyric ode sung to Dionysus, which started as an improvised  story danced to and sung by a choral leader and answered with a refrain  from a chorus of singer-dancers. Later, these hymns were written down.  The <i>dithyramb</i> evolved into tragedy when Thespis stepped out  of chorus and assumed character, thus becoming the very first actor.  That's why today we often refer to an actor as a &quot;thespian.&quot;  Tragedy then changed from being a narrative poetic form, with strong  lyrical elements, to an enacted or dramatic poetic form.</p>
<p><strong>Why was  tragedy so important to the Greeks?</strong><br>
 The ancient Athenians honored their gods at annual festivals, with  four festivals devoted to Dionysus, the god of wine, women and theatre.  The most important festival, the City Dionysia, took place in the  spring and offered a contest for the best trilogy of tragic plays.  A wealthy citizen, or choregus, paid for training and costuming of  the actors and the chorus and also supplied non-speaking supernumeraries.  For three days, audiences came to the Theatre of Dionysus at daybreak  to watch a trilogy of plays each day. These state-sponsored festivals  intertwined theatre, religion and politics and provided a forum for  the civic debate that was considered necessary for the health of Athens'  body politic. The tragic and--later, comic--playwrights openly criticized  the gods, the government, political leaders, and society's mores and  fashions, etc. Also, one of the fundamental aspects of the ancient  Greek ethos was the need to look at life from a cosmological worldview.  Living in the prospering democracy that was Athens, the great tragic  playwrights wrote plays that explored man's relationship to the gods,  the conflict between the individual and the state, and the role of  fate in determining the outcome of one's life. These writers were  not afraid to ask &quot;Why?&quot; nor were their audiences afraid  to ponder over their own responses.</p>
<p><strong>How did  the ancient Athenians produce the plays?</strong><br>
 Each playwright was provided with three male actors, who played all  of the roles regardless of the age or gender of the characters. The  playwrights themselves usually directed as well as often acted in  their plays. Sophocles' contemporary, Aeschylus, for instance, was  credited with possessing an excellent voice and bearing as an actor.  He usually acted the <i>protagonist</i>, or first-actor, roles in  his plays. Sophocles tried his hand at acting, but he found that he  did not possess a strong voice and so chose to focus on writing. Besides  the <i>protagonist</i>, each playwright was also assigned an antagonist,  or second actor, who played those characters who are in opposition  to the main character or <i>protagonist</i>. The third actor was called  the <i>tritagonist</i>, and he played the smaller roles in each play,  usually messengers and shepherds. Along with the <em>supernumeraries</em>,  who performed the non-speaking roles, each playwright was also assigned  a tragic <em>chorus </em>which consisted of 12 or 15 chorus members.</p>
<p><strong>If three  male actors played all of the roles, including the women characters,  what was the style of acting like?</strong><br>
 The style of acting can best be described as &quot;nonrealistic.&quot;  For starters, each actor wore a mask made of light wood, cork or linen  for each character he played. The face of the mask, or <i>persona</i>,  indicated the age, social standing and sex of the character as well  as the character's dominant emotion, such as fear, rage, hate, despair.  Each mask fit the actor's face, and the mask may have had a wig attached  to it and an open mouthpiece that allowed for clear speech. To a large  extent, the actor relied upon his mask and slow, stylized gestures  to convey his character. This very slow, stylized movement was fundamentally  necessary for performing in a large performance space like the Theatre  of Dionysus, which seated 20,000 people in its final form. </p>
<p>While theatres  like the Theatre of Dionysus and the Theatre at Epidauros possessed  truly excellent acoustics, Greek actors also placed a high premium  upon vocal quality. The actors needed to be comfortable in projecting  their voices into a large auditorium and relied upon vocal range and  expressiveness to convey character. Their speeches, recitatives and  songs were often spoken and sung in harmony to composed music, much  like opera is performed today. The delivery of the actors' speeches,  then, was more declamatory than &quot;realistic&quot; in tone. In  fact, the actor was often more concerned with portraying an emotional  tone than in depicting the age or gender of his character.</p>
<p>Finally, the chorus  played a very important role in the Greek theatre. Usually composed  of 12-15 members and led by a choral leader, the chorus sang and danced  to the choral odes or <em>stasima</em>. Depending upon the play, the  chorus portrayed the citizens or elders of the community. They also  functioned in the play by providing exposition (or background information),  commentary, narration and criticism of the motivations of the main  characters. In some of the plays, the chorus also introduced a new  character as he or she makes a first entrance, thus aiding the audience  in quickly understanding the play's <em>dramatis</em> <i>persona</i>e.</p>
<p><strong>What did  the plays consist of besides the stasima?</strong><br>
 The structure of a Greek tragedy usually began with a <em>prologos</em> (or prologue), a scene that provides dramatic exposition and usually  introduces the play's main characters. Following the <em>prologos</em> is the <em>parados</em>, the choral ode in which the chorus enters  or &quot;parades&quot; into the theatre. Then come a series of <em>episodes</em>,  or dramatic scenes, and <em>stasima</em>, with each episode followed  by a <em>stasima</em>. (<em>Episode</em>, by the way, means &quot;between  the songs.&quot;) Following the last episode is the <em>exodos</em>,  or the exit ode of the chorus, the chorus's last song. Sometimes,  too, the play might also end with an <em>epilogos</em> (or epilogue),  a scene which would provide closure to the dramatic events.<br>

 An Interview with Susan Watson Turner</strong><br>
 Director and producer Susan Watson Turner began her career in Cleveland,  Ohio, at the Karamu Theatre. She began acting at the Karamu and discovered  her now favorite theatrical activity, directing. She has directed  educational, community, regional, off-off Broadway, and off - Broadway  theatre. When reviewing her production of <em>North 17th Street </em>by  Clay Goss, Ben Brantley in The New York Times referred to her directorial  skill &quot;as elegant choreography.&quot; For several years, Ms.  Watson Turner served as General Manager and Producing Director at  the Negro Ensemble Company, where she worked on <em>A Soldier's Play,  Lifetimes on the Streets, Home, The Absolution of Willie Mae</em>,  and many other plays. During her term at NEC, she had the opportunity  to work with such talented actors, directors, designers and writers  as Frances Foster, Joseph Walker, Samm-Art Williams, Denzel Washington,  Wynn Thomas, Samuel L. Jackson and Douglas Turner Ward. Ms. Turner  has worked at the Village Gate Theatre, where she co-authored the  play <em>Just A Night Out</em> and the longest-running Black musical  in America, <em>Mama I Want To Sing</em> by Vy Higgensen. Ms. Watson  Turner has been a professor of theatre for Orange County Community  College, Bronx Community College and now Lehman College. She is the  recipient of a Doctoral Equivalency from the Board of Trustees-City  University of New York for Achievements in Theatre. She also holds  an MFA from Columbia University and a BFA from Ohio University. As  always she would like to thank her husband, Richard, and her family  for all their support. To God be the Glory--for all the things He  has done!</p>
<p><em>You've mentioned  that leadership is an important theme or component in terms of your  directorial interpretation of </em>Antigone<em>. Given our nation's  current political situation, how does <i>Antigone</i> speak to some  of the issues that we Americans face in the early part of the twenty-first  century?</em></p>
<p>Susan Watson Turner:  As Americans we have become very &quot;lazy&quot; when it comes to  politics. We sway the way the media pushes us and spend very little  time investigating the real backgrounds, qualifications and wisdom  of our candidates and ultimately leaders. I found a quote that encapsulates  my directorial approach: &quot;When leaders act contrary to conscience,  we must act contrary to leaders.&quot; The inequities we watch today  (via TV, newspapers and the Internet) are in some cases parallel to  the actions of Creon. What do we do as individuals--as citizens, as  artists, as teachers--to encourage action against what we know and  understand to be unjust behavior? </p>
<p><em>Sophocles  wrote </em>Antigone<em> in 442 or 441 BC. Besides exploring the role  of leadership, in what ways does the play reverberate for contemporary  audiences? In other words, why should we read or see or listen to  this play today?</em></p>
<p>SWT: I think my  response above also answers this question. However, the &quot;real&quot;  tragedy that Sophocles could not have imagined in 442 BC is that thousands  of years later we would not have learned from this straightforward  example of how arrogance, abuse and ego have the potential to destroy  humanity. In fact, his references to mythological punishments from  the gods for vanity, selfishness and arrogance (i.e., Niobe's Tears)  are placed to support his position. Sophocles' play is support for  my contemporary position. For example, our continued abuse of our  environment is captured in the prologue of this translation. We find  the chorus in a barren uninhabitable land suffering the results of  environmental abuse. Sophocles has written a choral speech which refers  to &quot;Earth as a goddess. She never ages, never grows tired. Yet,  man wears her away.&quot; And today, my fish still die in tap water!  Have we understood the message Sophocles intended? </p>
<p><em>Ancient Athenian  theatre practice combined music, dance, spectacle, song and language  in order to tell a story, retell a myth or portray a dramatic event  close to the audience's sensibilities. Describe how the work of your  collaborators--the work of your choreographer and your designers--may  perhaps dramatize or theatricalize the production.</em></p>
<p>SWT: The choreography  by Dyane Harvey heightens the element of spectacle. The dance lends  itself to myth by reinforcing the words of the storyteller/chorus  visually through body language. The chorus extends reality and becomes  a vehicle for the gods to impact man. Richard Ellis (set designer)  and Ken Ross (lighting designer) are developing a visual look that  is &quot;larger than life&quot; and provides periodic elements of  surprise. The set will open magically to reveal entrances, and the  orchestra pit will rise and fall amidst smoke and sound which will  heighten the performance visually. The sound, composed by Richard  V. Turner, will combine natural sound and composed music. Special  sound f/x will shake the stage and topple the elements in full surround  sound into the audiences' lap. Given the proscenium nature of the  Lovinger Theatre, we will rely on the sound and chorus to bridge the  distance between the large stage and intimate message. As the gods  grant us, one of our cast members is a professional magician, and  he will add his special talent of magic as part of the victory celebration.  The convention I'm using to keep the contemporary audience's attention  is to enact the choral sections and keep the language simple. </p>
<p><em>In what ways--if  any--are you adapting the play for a modern audience?</em></p>
<p>SWT: The costumes,  by costume designer Susan Soetaert, really represent the adaptation.  They have the lines and style of ancient Greek fashion with a contemporary  construction and fabric. The costumes reflect my concept of staying  within the Greek frame and bringing contemporary hints of fashion  to the visual design to aide/ease the understanding of the play. In  the adaptation, I have changed words and syntax for clarity's sake,  staying true, I hope, to the rhythms of Greek language and speech.  Of course, the rainbow of skin tones and ethnicities are being forced  into the Greek frame--such is the need to &quot;color,&quot; for lack  of a better word, the other sensual elements (i.e. the music will  have little Greek sound--will attempt to be timeless--but have hints  of modern and African-based sounds provided by the percussion instrumentation.  It also helps to have a beat!)</p>
<p><em>Why have you  chosen those adaptations?</em></p>
<p>SWT: Clarity,  Clarity, Clarity, Clarity. My goal is to make this production exciting,  entertaining and engaging. I have furthered the adaptation to portray  the <i>Antigone</i>'s hanging, Haemon's suicide, as well as Eurydice's  self-destruction to bloodily illustrate the reality of Creon's mistake.  We see participate and experience the tragedy. We are not casual observers.  My goal is that we experience this pain as audience members and share  in the responsibility with the chorus when we do not speak out or  speak out too late! </p>
<p><strong>Synopsis of Oedipus Rex</strong></p>
<p>A common misconception about <i>Antigone</i> is that Sophocles wrote  it as the second play of a tragic trilogy of plays. Nothing could  be further from the truth, as <i>Antigone</i> was written in 442 or  441 BC and <em>Oedipus Rex</em> and <em>Oedipus at Colonus</em> were  written in 430-425 BC and 406 BC respectively. These three plays,  though, are thematically related and often referred to as the &quot;Oedipal  Cycle&quot; or the &quot;Theban Plays&quot; since they explore the  myth of Oedipus.</p>
<p>The story begins  when the Oracle of Delphi predicts that King Laius of Thebes will  be killed by his infant son, Oedipus. Laius and Jocasta, Oedipus's  mother, decide to abandon the child on a mountainside to die. But  the child is saved by a shepherd and taken to Corinth, where he is  raised by Polybus and Merope, the king and queen of Corinth. When  Oedipus hears of the prophecy that he will kill his father and marry  his mother, however, he leaves Corinth, not aware that Polybus and  Merope are not his real parents. Along the road to Thebes, he encounters  Laius, and the two men get into an argument, which results in Oedipus  killing Laius. Soon thereafter Oedipus arrives in Thebes and saves  the city by answering the Riddle of the Sphinx. He is proclaimed the  king of Thebes and married to Jocasta, with whom he sires four children,  Polynices, Eteocles, Ismene and <i>Antigone</i>.</p>
<p>When <em>Oedipus  Rex </em>begins, a plague has descended upon Thebes. The Oracle at  Delphi tells Oedipus that he must end the plague by finding and punishing  the murderer of King Laius. Acting rashly and unwittingly, Oedipus  declares that Laius's murderer will be banished from Thebes. Over  the course of the play, Oedipus discovers that he himself has murdered  Laius and married Jocasta. Confronted with the truth of Oedipus' identity,  Jocasta hangs herself and Oedipus blinds himself, leaving Thebes and  his young children, <i>Antigone</i> and Ismene in Creon's care.</p>
<p>Creon, Jocasta's  brother, is chosen to rule Thebes until one of Oedipus's sons, Eteocles  or Polynices, is old enough to rule. The two brothers agree to rule  Thebes jointly, but Eteocles reneges on their agreement. Polynices  raises an army to fight his brother and claim the throne, and in a  battle both Eteocles and Polynices die. Creon declares himself the  king, gives Eteocles a proper burial, but decrees that Polynices as  a traitor to Thebes must not be given a proper burial rituals. At  this point Sophocles' <i>Antigone</i> begins.</p>
<h2>Questions for Discussion</h2>
<p>The following  questions have been designed for a classroom discussion of <i>Antigone</i> either after you have read the play or seen the Lehman College Theatre  Program production.</p>
</div>
<blockquote>
 <div class=Section1>1.  Does Antigone have the right to defy Creon by burying her brother,  Polynices? Why do you think that she feels she has this right?</div>
 <div class=Section1>2.  Does Creon have the right to enforce the laws of society by punishing  the person who gives Polynices a burial?</div>
 <div class=Section1>3.  What might be Creon's motivation for having denied Polynices a burial?</div>
 <div class=Section1>4.  Who is the <i>protagonist</i> in the play, <em>Antigone </em>or Creon?  Why do you think that this character is the <i>protagonist</i>?</div>
 <div class=Section1>5. <i>Antigone</i> is considered one of the greatest roles for an actress  to play. Do you think, though, that she is more than a flesh-and-blood  character, that she represents some sort of an idea or ideal? If so,  what is that idea or ideal?</div>
