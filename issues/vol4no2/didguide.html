  <p>Guidelines for Contributors</p>
  <p><strong>General</strong></p>
  <p>Contributors to <em>Didaskalia</em> should remember first and foremost that they are writing for a diverse audience which may not be familiar with the jargon of a given field, although most will have at least general knowledge of the ancient playwrights and their more famous plays. Some of our readers are interested spectators or passionate amateurs with no formal training; some are highly trained specialists whose training does not carry over into other disciplines. As we are trying to encourage a dialogue, we want our readers to be able to understand what we say.</p>
  <p>Secondly, contributions should if possible be kept to under 2000 words. Features and reviews should express their main points clearly and concisely and then, if appropriate, make suggestions for further reading. Longer or more scholarly treatises on ancient performance should be directed to <em>Electronic Antiquity</em> c/o <a href="mailto:antiquity-editor@classics.utas.edu.au">antiquity-editor@classics.utas.edu.au</a>.</p>
  <p>In general, contributors may follow the spelling conventions most comfortable for them. Although there is no imposed house style for submissons, in an effort to be consistent within the newsletter we ask contributors to follow these few guidelines:</p>
  <p><strong>Format</strong></p>
  <p>Please submit only one version of the text of your contribution. The editors will reformat the ASCII text for the HTML version. Do not use any special characters, accents, or sequence of commands + letters/numbers (e.g. acute accent on e or option + hyphen for the extended dash) in files sent directly as e-mail messages. (They may not arrive looking the way they did when sent.) Formatted documents may be sent as MIME (Apple II) encoded attachements, but this makes extra work for the editors. The plainer the text the better!</p>
  <p>Since we cannot yet transmit Greek or other alphabets, and because not all our readers know that language, please transliterate <em>without</em> diacritical marks (these do not transmit) and place the transliterated word(s) between asterisks (*). </p>
  <p>If you wish to emphasise a word or phrase, please place between asterisks (*).</p>
  <p><strong>Illustrations</strong></p>
  <p>If you are including illustrations, please indicate where in your text you would like them to be placed. Illustrations should be submitted either as high-contrast photgraphs or drawings (A4 size or smaller) or on disk as .gif or .jpg files smaller than 640x480 pixels. Images may be sent as MIME (AppleII) encoded attachments to e-mail messages.</p>
  <p><strong>Listings</strong></p>
  <p>Listings and annoucements should include title, date, time, location, phone/fax/hardcopy address/internet address, admission price, and short description of event.</p>
  <p><strong>References</strong></p>
  <p>Place names of ancient works and all titles of books or plays within asterisks, thus: Aeschylus, *Agamemnon*</p>
  <p>Give the foot note indicator in the text in parentheses; place the footnotes themselves at the end of the document. Do not use any superscript or subscript forms in the text or foot notes. (Any necessary reformatting and linking will be done by the editors.) We urge you to use as few footnotes as possible and to integrate ancient references and modern ones as far as possible into the text.</p>
  <p>Set out references to modern works as follows (note the use of asterisks and pagination in full): 
  <ul>
 <li>Keith Johnstone, *Impro: Improvisation and the Theatre*  (New York, 1981), p. 90. </li>
 <li>Elaine Fantham, 'Sex, Status, and Survival in Hellenistic  Athens: A Study of Women in New Comedy,' *Phoenix* 29 (1975), pp.  53-5. </li>
  </ul>
  <p>When citing again, please use short titles of books or articles.</p>
  <p>When citing electronic sources, please follow the guidelines laid out by Janice Walker on her <a
  href="http://www.cas.usf.edu/english/walker/mla.html">MLA Style Sheet</a>.</p>
  <h3><strong>Where to send your work</strong></h3>
  <p>Contributions should be submitted either by e-mail or on disk; the preferred method is by e-mail. If there is no alternative but to submit hard copy, the document <em>must</em> be clear enough to be scanned electronically.</p>
  <p>Hardcopy and disks should be sent to:</p>
