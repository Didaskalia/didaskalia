Hippolytus is the thirty-fourth Bradfield Greek play.
It has always been the aim that our audiences leave the theatre feeling they know in essence what the Greek audiences of 2500 years ago saw and heard.
We also try to avoid an over-literal approach.
The original Greek, vivid spectacle, and authentic costume designs are backed by contemporary music and choreography.
This production of Hippolytus is an ideal introduction to the traditions of Greek Theatre; 
a must for all students of Classics and Theatre Studies.
