  Millennium Responses: (Dis)Placing Classical Greek Theatre<br>
  <br>
  International Theatre Conference<br>
  <br>
  September 18-22, 1997<br>
  <br>
  Aristotle University<br>
  Thessaloniki<br>
  Greece<br>
  <br>
  Since the early 17th century, when the 'battle of the books' began (La<br>
  wuerelle des anciens et des modernes), the question has always been more 
  or<br>
  less the same: what is our relationship with ancient Greek drama? In what<br>
  ways is Greek tragedy (or comedy) related to our times and interests? 
  Can it<br>
  be reconstructed, and at what price? Is teh concept ofits 'universality'<br>
  viable as a Greek dramatic discourse in a world of postmodern explosions 
  and<br>
  implosions, of constant dis-placements and re-placements, of severe<br>
  questioning of Eurocentric ideals and discourses? Can it in any way<br>
  participate constructively in contemporary theoretical debate?<br>
  <br>
  With tehse questions in mind, the Theatre Sector of teh Department of<br>
  English, School of Philosoph of Aristotle University has decided, in<br>
  collaboration with teh International Federation for Theatre Research, 
  and<br>
  under the auspices of 'Thessaloniki: CUltural Capital of EUrope--1997,' 
  to<br>
  organize this international conference in the hope of bringing together<br>
  scholars from various fields as well as dramatists and theatre practitioners<br>
  in an open debate about the position of ancient Greek drama in a rapidly<br>
  changing postmodern society. We thus invite papers which focus on such<br>
  issues as:<br>
  <br>
    * Ancient Greek drama and postmodernist aesthetics<br>
    * The Greek ideal and the 'Other'<br>
    * Eurocentrism and orientalism<br>
    * High and low culture<br>
    * Socio-cultural, ideological and political mediations<br>
    * Feminism and the Classics<br>
    * Staging the classics/appropriations/reconstructions/adaptations<br>
    * Greek classics and interculturalism<br>
  <br>
  We are open to further suggestions for the organization of special workshops<br>
  or thematic units. Selected papers presented at the conference will be<br>
  published.<br>
  <br>
  Languages<br>
  <br>
  Greek, English, and French (plenary sessions will have simultaneous<br>
  translation)<br>

  Aeneid Reading<br>
  <br>
  The Le Moyne Classics Society in conjunction with the Le Moyne Jubilee<br>
  Academic Programming Subcommittee announces the first in the Jubilee<br>
  Classics Series, a marathon reading in English of Vergil&#237;s Aeneid.<br>
  <br>
  The event will take place at the Firehouse Theater on Saturday, September 
  28<br>
  beginning at 11:00 AM and will continue until completion (approximately<br>
  12:00 midnight).<br>
  <br>
  The *Aeneid* is the Roman national epic written by the poet Vergil (70 
  BC-19<br>
  BC). It tells of the wanderings of the Trojan hero Aeneas, whom the Romans<br>
  regarded as the founder of their race, and is considered one of the most<br>
  influential works of ancient literature. Ancient poetry and epic were 
  often<br>
  publically presented by their authors, but in the modern world such works<br>
  are rarely experienced by a live audience. This event attempts to recreate<br>
  that sense of living classical poetry by a reading of the whole *Aeneid*<br>
  from beginning to end.<br>
  <br>
  Our readers include both Le Moyne faculty and students, and as an added<br>
  bonus two high school instructors from our local Latin teachers' group 
  ATLAS<br>
  (Association of Teachers of Latin Around Syracuse) will also participate.<br>
  One of them will be asssisted by some of her Latin IV students in reading<br>
  Book 3.<br>
  <br>
  Free refreshments will be available throughout the event.<br>
  <br>
  Free pizza will be served after the reading of Book 6 (about 5:00 PM).<br>

  Add Your Pictures to Perseus<br>
  <br>
  The Perseus Project has set up an experimental system for adding outside<br>
  pictures to its image database. If you have pictures of Greek or Roman<br>
  sites, builidngs, sculpture, vases, coins, or other objects, and you have<br>
  the pictures up on the Web (i.e. you can send us a URL for the picture),<br>
  mail me and I'll give you an account to add to our database.<br>
  <br>
  You can either add a reference to your picture (i.e. users of Perseus 
  will<br>
  see links to pictures on your server) or submit the picture itself, in 
  which<br>
  case we'll archive the picture on our server. Once you have an account,<br>
  there's a simple HTML form to fill out and your pictures will be instantly<br>
  folded into the Perseus database. To see how your pictures will show up 
  on<br>
  existing Perseus catalog entries, check out this URL:<br>
  <br>
  http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/sculptureindex?entry=Athens,+Acropolis+698<br>
  <br>
  If you have a large number of images on the web, you'll probably find 
  that<br>
  fill out the form for each image is tedious. In that case, drop me a line<br>
  and we can talk about transferring your URLs as one big file.<br>
  <br>
  I hope to hear from you soon,<br>

  The Archive of Performances of Greek and Roman Drama<br>
  <br>
  The Archive of Performances of Greek and Roman Drama, under the joint<br>
  direction of Oliver Taplin and Edith Hall, is a multi-disciplined research<br>
  venture dedicated to establishing an international performance history 
  of<br>
  classical drama on the modern stage. Based at Oxford University's European<br>
  Humanities Research Centre, the Archive will employ a powerful relational<br>
  database in its compilation of a thoroughly cross-referenced register 
  of<br>
  these performances, from the Renaissance to the present day. In conjunction<br>
  with this electronically stored performance history, the Archive will<br>
  include a significant holding of published and unpublished documentation<br>
  pertaining to ancient drama on the modern stage. In the new year the Archive<br>
  will be issuing a call for information and materials relevant to the<br>
  project.<br>

  Call for Papers: Graduate Students' Conference<br>
  <br>
  Viva Voce: Echoes of Performance in the Ancient Text<br>
  <br>
  February 7-8, 1997<br>
  <br>
  Brown University<br>
  Providence RI.<br>
  <br>
  The aim of this conference is to reassess the performative quality of 
  Greek<br>
  and Roman texts, and map its extension into other modes of discourse, 
  other<br>
  cultural institutions, and even into the medium of the text, where<br>
  performance is usually said to come to an end. In so doing we hope to<br>
  refocus our attentions on the power performance exerted over its ancient<br>
  audiences and improve our appreciation of this aspect of the works.<br>
  <br>
  We invite submissions which deal with a range of issues starting from, 
  but<br>
  not limited to, the following: criteria for distinguishing the performative<br>
  quality of the texts; the place and power of performance in philosophy, 
  in<br>
  oratory; the ideology and ritual which underlie and accompany performance;<br>
  settings for performance other than the theater; and finally, the transition<br>
  from performance to writing. In addition to panel discussions on these 
  and<br>
  similar topics, we will also hold a roundtable devoted to one or two<br>
  questions of broader interest.<br>
  <br>
  3 copies of one-page abstracts, anonymous but with cover letter indicating<br>
  name, address, affiliation, and paper title, should be sent by October 
  15,<br>
  1996, to Viva Voce Abstracts, c/o Dept. of Classics, Box 1856, Brown<br>
  University, Providence RI, 02912-1856. Questions may be sent via e-mail 
  to<br>
