    <em>Trent University</em></p>
   <p>&ldquo;Pay attention! Now I&rsquo;ll begin to weave the plot&rdquo; (<em>MG</em> 98).</p>
<p>In February 2014, I directed the Classics Drama Group (CDG) of Trent University as it staged its 23rd ancient play in English translation: Plautus&rsquo; <em>Miles Gloriosus</em>, performed as <em>A Warrior Vainglorious </em>(image 1).<span class="footnote" href="#">1</span> Readers of <em>Didaskalia</em> will not need convincing of the importance of staging the plays of the ancient world. Whether seeking some form of &lsquo;authenticity&rsquo; or reimagining an ancient piece completely, modern stagings provide unique perspectives on the function of theatre, both ancient and contemporary.<span class="footnote" href="#">2</span> What I propose here is not a defense of the staging process, or of any of the decisions made for our production, but rather a few of the insights it afforded on the stagecraft of antiquity and the difficulties of staging ancient drama today.</p>
<p>To provide some context: our performance space is Nozhem in the First Peoples&rsquo; House of Learning at Trent University. Designed primarily for use by the Indigenous Studies program, it is essentially a black-box theatre with seating for about 90 people. There is no stage but an open floor space with curtains on three sides; the audience sits in bleachers, thus forming the &lsquo;fourth wall&rsquo;. We used modern lighting, with a basic &lsquo;daylight&rsquo; wash throughout: lights up to start the show, lights down to close it. The set was a flat backdrop with two doorways, brought further forward than the space required in order to reproduce the wide, shallow stage of Plautus&rsquo; day (image 2). A foley artist, with a door machine and other sound-effects devices, sat forward in plain view of the audience. These were the conditions I set for us as we began the rehearsal process. All dialogue was spoken, rather than sung, and there was minimal musical accompaniment.</p>
   <p><strong>Focus and Asides</strong>:</p>
     <p>Much has been said about the function and operation of asides in Roman Comedy. The greatest challenge is the behavior of characters who cannot hear each other despite standing in close proximity. In original practice, this process was facilitated by the use of masks: conceptually, masks do not have peripheral vision and it is easy for an actor to not perceive something nearby.<span class="footnote" href="#">3</span> In our modern production without masks (I note a partial exception below), a great deal of experiment was necessary to make these scenes work. As noted, the set was far forward, imitating the shallow stage space of Plautus&rsquo; day, with little space for actors to disengage realistically. This required some very careful blocking of actors. Palaestrio in particular was forced to move constantly to accommodate the dialogue and movement of other characters – appropriate to a high-energy, almost manic character.</p>
     <p>Sharp, deliberate movements were therefore necessary. Practitioners of theatre know that quick movement draws &lsquo;focus&rsquo;: actors on stage during another&rsquo;s monologue, for example, must artificially limit their movement and reaction in order not to draw audience attention away from the speaking character. Walking forward did not &lsquo;sell&rsquo; a character&rsquo;s disengagement with events on stage, but a quick step forward and a lean toward the audience was more effective, even if the distance covered was less. Characters could then speak asides directly in front of another character, seemingly oblivious. Palaestrio and Milphidippa in act IV, for example, comment on each other&rsquo;s performances (&ldquo;How&rsquo;s that? Am I doing well?&rdquo; &ldquo;Holy Herc, I can&rsquo;t stop laughing!&rdquo; <em>MG</em> 1075–76), and do so by leaning across Pyrgopolynices to speak to each other.<span class="footnote" href="#">4</span> The close-proximity aside had other, unintended benefits: Pyrgopolynices is subsequently unable to accomplish such asides himself even though he thinks he can (image 3): he somehow does not know the &lsquo;rules&rsquo; by which these asides operate.<span class="footnote" href="#">5</span> As part of the performance it was the work of other actors to accommodate his asides, making room for him as he moved about and carefully allowing him the illusion of secrecy despite his loud and obtrusive comments.</p>
     <p>A successful theatrical presentation must work hard to establish certain &lsquo;ground rules&rsquo; of the dramatic world. Our audiences, while always supportive, are more familiar with the conventions of television and film than with those of live theatre. Ancient theatre, awash with difficult names and staging conventions of its own, is doubly challenging. In this light, the opening act, a two-hander between Pyrgopolynices and Artotrogus the parasite, is a vital piece. In function, the scene resembles the &lsquo;cold open&rsquo; in a modern sitcom: a bit of humor before the opening credits and a promise of the jokes to come (and, for the ancient audience, a promise that there is a soldier in the play, since he won&rsquo;t appear again for nearly 800 lines). In this scene, we were able to establish several basic rules of this dramatic world, including the soldier&rsquo;s total insensitivity to what is going on around him.</p>
     <p>Casting always makes a difference as well. The actor playing Pyrgopolynices (Kevin Price) was very tall (image 4); other actors easily fit under him, and his face was visible at all times. This meant that his eyes could always be seen and &lsquo;tracked&rsquo; by the spectator as he stared off into oblivion when characters around him spoke. His height, augmented by a tall hat, also helped render his asides ineffective. This is not to say a short actor would have been unsuitable, but the blocking would have played out differently. We know little about the actors of antiquity, but physical features like height must surely have made a difference in the staging of individual plays.</p>
     <p>The other major victim of asides, Sceledrus, posed slightly different problems, precisely because the actor (Brandon Doxtator) was shorter than many of the others. Part of the actor&rsquo;s characterization of Sceledrus involved a great deal of stooping, further reducing his apparent height. Misdirection of the eyes in a way that tracked for the audience was therefore more difficult (i.e. the audience could not see his eyes on a clearly separate register, as they could for Pyrgopolynices). Frequent reference in the text to squinting, however, led us to costume him with a pair of large red glasses (image 5), which came to define what Sceledrus could see (and hear) . These glasses were the closest we came to using a mask in this production, and created the same spotlight effect as the original (squinting) mask would have done. They readily demonstrate that almost anything on an actor&rsquo;s face becomes a mask.<span class="footnote" href="#">6</span></p>
   <p><strong>Repetition and Stage Business</strong></p>
     <p><em>Miles Gloriosus</em> is, to a modern audience, highly repetitive. The characters of this comedy, especially Palaestrio, constantly remind each other of what they are up to. Several scenes include sustained &lsquo;info-dumps&rsquo; in which characters explain one of the two deception plots or (again, especially in the case of Palaestrio) lay out a scene to come (image 6).<span class="footnote" href="#">7</span> Several scenes (the deception of Sceledrus, for example, as Philocomasium pops in and out of different doors) are entirely stage-managed before they even occur. Dramaturgically, this repetition compensates for the transient nature of ancient Roman audiences. Spectators could come and go whenever they wanted. Multiple attractions occurred simultaneously at many <em>ludi</em>, and not everyone made it to the opening of the play (and through word of mouth from fellow audience members). Spectators who arrived late were kept informed as characters reconstructed the plot for them. This of course was not an issue for our audience, as we took the traditional approach of contemporary theatre: the audience entered, sat in seats, and were expected to remain attentive while the lights were on.</p>
     <p>One upshot of this frequent repetition and foreshadowing was that it opened the way for a great deal of extraneous stage business – as it must have done in Plautus&rsquo; day as well. When most, if not all, of an audience understand the dynamics of a scene before it plays out, specific dialogue becomes less important. The seduction of Pyrgopolynices in Act IV (<em>MG</em> 1216–83) is a good example. Dramaturgically, the scene is complex, beginning with two pairs of characters: Pyrgopolynices and Palaestrio eavesdropping on Acroteleutium and Milphidippa. Halfway through the scene, Milphidippa and Paleastrio switch places to reconfigure the pairings, and Palaestrio and Acroteleutium become the observers as Milphidippa flatters the soldier. Three of the four characters are aware of the true agenda of the scene, and it is therefore the oblivious soldier who is the butt of the humor. Palaestrio is the denominator to both observing pairs, as he becomes, in a sense, audience to the deception plot he himself has written and arranged. Throughout, the reactions of the observing characters are free to be extreme and the actors need not worry about drawing focus from the speaker. The audience may lose a line or two of dialogue to these distracting over-reactions, but the meaning of the scene, so carefully explained and orchestrated in advance, is not in any way threatened. Big laughs are therefore possible through the physical comedy of the non-speaking actors.</p>
  <p><strong>The Faint</strong></p>
     <p>As Marshall notes, the faint of Philocomasium—the theatrical sleight of hand that has her fall into the arms of Pleusicles, disguised as a sea-captain, rather than Pyrgopolynices—is one of the most challenging moments in the Plautine corpus from a staging standpoint (<em>MG</em> 1329–31).<span class="footnote" href="#">8</span> Though it can only take a second or two, the faint must be accomplished smoothly or it tracks as highly artificial. I do not mean unnatural—in this dramatic world where a character might not hear a conversation three feet away, a stylized and deliberate faint might be appropriate. Rather, I mean in such a way as to interrupt the dramatic flow of the scene and disrupt the theatrical illusion. Thus, a very delicate balance must be struck between the deliberate stage action and the naturalistic speed of a faint. Palaestrio narrates the action here—which is the only way we know of this stage business. In the original production, Philocomasium may have been played by the same actor as Lurcio, who clearly had some facility as a tumbler or acrobat.<span class="footnote" href="#">9</span></p>
     <p>The trick here is to allow an elaborate sequence of actions to occur in front of a character without his realizing what is going on, a maneuver much more complex than a simple aside. Speed is an important element that must be controlled. For the actor simply to collapse would be too quick an action for an audience to track well: it is over before the audience can process what is happening. Consider any comedy faint you have seen on television or film: they never occur quickly, and are usually preceded by comedic pause while the actor pulls a funny face. The full fall is rarely shown, with the frame of the camera carefully placed at the point where an actor would lose control of downward momentum. In <em>Miles Gloriosus</em>, the joke continues for another 20 lines (roughly 1329–49; it is unclear exactly when Philocomasium rises from Pleusicles&rsquo; arms), as Pyrgopolynices slowly suspects there might be another reason for Philocomasium and the sea captain to remain in each other&rsquo;s arms. In our production, the soldier held his arms out and closed his eyes, waiting for the embrace. Philocomasium ducked under his embrace and Palaestrio embraced the soldier as a distraction, whilst inventing and directing the faint over the soldier&rsquo;s shoulder (image 7). The closed eyes of the soldier allowed these actions to happen sequentially, rather than simultaneously, facilitating the audience&rsquo;s comprehension of the scene: Philocomasium ducks the embrace, moves to the sea captain, and Palaestrio embraces the soldier. This both solved the timing issue and also maintained Palaestrio&rsquo;s role as director and improviser of the action.</p>
   <p><strong>Directing, Inside and Out</strong></p>
     <p>This was my fifth outing as director for the CDG, and my own connection with the troupe goes back to my undergraduate days. Two factors made this production stand out for me. One was that this was the first time the troupe had officially attempted Roman comedy.<span class="footnote" href="#">10</span> The other lay in the casting of our lead, Palaestrio. Very early in the rehearsal process, the actor I had cast was forced to drop out of the role. After several false starts in replacing that actor, I finally took on the role myself (I had been reading for the role in rehearsal already). It was only with the help and support of an excellent cast and crew that I could perform both as actor and director.</p>
     <p>But in the end, of course, acting and directing are exactly what I did, inside and out. In the world of the play, Palaestrio takes on a directorial role, marshalling his co-conspirators for the benefit of Sceldrus and the soldier, his audience. The action of the comedy is often expressed in theatrical terms.<span class="footnote" href="#">11</span> Palaestrio&rsquo;s meta-theatrical prologue, in which he is privy to the plot of the play before it happens, reinforces his directorial aspect (<em>MG</em> 79–153). This double role of mine (director as actor as director) folds in on itself even further when understood in terms of its historical counterpart. If Plautus was part of his acting troupe (as he surely was), it is easy to imagine him choosing to play the role of Palaestrio.<span class="footnote" href="#">12</span> Thus the scriptmaster and director, ancient and modern, plays the role of a character who writes and directs the script as he goes along.</p>
     <p>Many of these observations are idiosyncratic and peculiar to our production. This is as it should be: without difference from one show to another, there would be no living theatrical tradition. But what this examination does show, I hope, is that there is a connection, however tenuous, to that first performance. Our critical lenses change from time to time, but the needs of the stage, expressed in physical terms, are often absolute. The play was a joy to produce, and I must assume that Plautus, too, must have had a great time at the <em>Ludi</em>.<span class="footnote" href="#">13</span></p>
