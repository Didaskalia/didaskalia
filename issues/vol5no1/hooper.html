 PERFORMING GREEK TRAGEDY: A DIRECTOR'S VIEW</p>
  <p>From his experience in directing and performing in classical Greek theatre, Elric Hooper makes observations on the difficulties and delights in staging the tragedies for contemporary audiences. The decay of cultural reference and the development of the post modern sensibility create problems and liberties unknown to former generations of directors. The importance of music and choreography which he places on the mounting of the tragedies has been reinforced by Hooper's wide experience in staging opera. <br>
