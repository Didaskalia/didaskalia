  <h2>OEDIPUS AT THIS POINT IN TIME: DIVINE WILL ON A SECULAR STAGE</h2>

  <p>An essential element in the conception of tragedy, from its Greek beginnings through its various transformations to the modern stage, is a focus on the significance of emotion in human experience. In the Greek context this is manifested (a) in the role of emotion as an element in perception and a consequent motivator of action, and (b) as the process of feeling (or perception) to action on the part of individuals is resolved into a pattern (the narrative) which is the manifestation of divine will. In effect tragedy as a form encapsulates an inherent conflict between a human world of feeling and limited perception and a non-human world of arbitrary forces. The same structure and dynamic informs tragedies of other periods, from Shakespeare's christianised conflict of good and evil, to Becket's void in <em>Godot</em>. The dramatic force of Greek tragedies on a modern stage arises from this dynamic and the essentially ironic theatrical relationship that it generates between stage and audience.<br>
 </p>
  <p><em>OC</em> differs from its companion plays (<em>OT</em> and <em>Ant</em>) in one important respect - the latter resolve the ironic relation between stage and audience in the intense finality of the tragic climax, thus foregrounding the characters in the context of their tragic world. <em>OC</em> maintains a wider focus on the nature of the world itself, in which the vast emotional range of Oedipus is drawn explicitly into the metaphysical structure, while the remaining characters continue to stumble on in a world that is beyond their immediate comprehension. The play is perhaps Sophocles' most explicit delineation of a tragic world and the manner in which natural forces manifest themselves through the emotional lives of human beings.<br>
 </p>
  <p>The clips that follow attempt to explicate the dual emotional structure of the play. Individual episodes are characterised by emotional pressures which drive the characters through a continuous narrative that encompasses past and future (specifically <em>OT</em> and <em>Ant</em>). The narrative is divinity at work and has its own emotional characteristics; ie, the powers of love, hate and their variants, which are exhibited in the world itself and which are beyond the comprehension of ordinary mortals, even as they are affected by them.</p>
