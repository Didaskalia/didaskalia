 <b>Pseudolus: <i>servus</i> <i>callidus</i></b><br>
 <img src="monaghan/pseud01.JPG" width="150" height="357"></p>
  <p><i>Mask</i><br>
 He has a large head with a fierce appearance, and a large trumpet mouth. The eyes are wide open, with above them asymmetrical brows with the tips drawn together. The hair is reddish.</p>
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  <p><i>Humour</i><br>
 As the servus callidus of the play, Pseudolus is elan vital personified. He is a combination of bomolochos and eiron, and as such is driven by love of 'the deception game' more than anything else. It is Pseudolus, as leader of 'the Fun Party' who is primarily responsible for the conduct of the performance. He is far more mobile than he is mechanical, is a chameleon, and able to take on roles, improvise, and get out of a tight spot (though by the skin of his teeth sometimes). He loves bluffing and lying, including to the audience to whom he 'plays' a great deal in performance. He is insolent to his elder master, Simo, belches in his face when drunk, and is unafraid of punishment.<br>
 </p>
  
  <p><b>Calidorus: <i>adulescens</i></b><br>
 <b><img src="monaghan/callid02.JPG" width="150" height="229"></b></p>
  <p><i>Mask</i><br>
 He is young and pallid, with a crown of hair. His lowered brows suggest a tragic demeanor. His general appearance, less exaggerated than most others, suggests the delicacy of one reared in the shade, and he appears cultured rather than athletic.</p>
  <p><i>Humour</i><br>
 Calidorus is a delicate &quot;blade of grass&quot;. He is desperately in love with Phoenicium, and wretchedly unhappy at the prospect of losing her. Hopeless in a tight situation, all he can do is burst into tears and wail about how unhappy he is. Still a little boy, he loves to be melodramatic and silly. He thinks Ballio is a beast.<br>
 </p>
  
  <p><b>Simia: young <i>servus callidus</i></b><br>
 <b><img src="monaghan/simia03.JPG" width="173" height="415"></b></p>
  <p><i>Mask</i><br>
 His mask is similar to Pseudolus: Trumpet mouth; more open eyes; reddish hair; raised, asymmetrical brows with the tips drawn together; fierce appearance, big head.</p>
  <p><i>Humour</i><br>
 As Pseudolus' pupil, Simia has all the attributes of a young seruus callidus: he is insolent, clever, rugged and quick thinking. He is so good at being bad, Pseudolus is scared that he too will feel his pupil's bite.</p>
  
  <p><b>Ballio: <i>leno</i></b><br>
 <b><img src="monaghan/ball04.jpg" width="150" height="286"></b></p>
  <p><i>Mask</i><br>
 He has curly hair and a long beard, but is bald on his forehead and pate. His brows are clenched, one of them is raised, and he has a slight grin on his lips.</p>
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  <p><i>Humour</i><br>
 Ballio is the alazon, the 'Arch Baddie', the 'bastard' of the play, and totally 'in bondage' to his work. As leader of 'the Money Team', he is driven by a desire for money: procuring it and keeping it. He will break an oath as soon as click his fingers, especially when a profit is to be made. Quite prepared to threaten - and carry out - physical punishment and prostitution if his orders are not carried out, he is also pitiless towards young lovers. He is also impervious to insults, which he accepts as fully justified but irrelevant, and there is a strong suggestion of pede-rasty with the 'puer'. He demands gifts from his boys and girls for his birthday. <br>
 His other desire is to beat Pseudolus at his own game and see him in the torture room.</p>
  <p><br>
 </p>
  <p><b>Simo:<i> senex iratus</i></b><br>
 <b><img src="monaghan/simo05.JPG" width="150" height="349"></b></p>
  <p><i>Mask</i><br>
 He has a wreath of hair around his head and a beard. He has a flat face, a hooked nose, is gloomy around the eyes, and the right brow is raised.</p>
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  <p><i>Humour</i><br>
 Like Ballio, Simo is 'bonded to work'. He is very 'careful' with his money, a preoccupation that Pseudolus plays on in the finale. As father of Calidorus, and (senior) master of Pseudolus, Simo is caustic and suspicious, and furious at the amatory antics of his son. He would love to see his slave permanently in the torture room. Although one of the 'blocking agents' in the play and punished as such, he is nevertheless handled more sympathetically than Ballio, and is assimilated rather than expelled from the play community.<br>
 </p>
  
  <p><b>Harpax: <i>bonus servus militis</i></b><br>
 <b><img src="monaghan/harp06.JPG" width="170" height="412"></b></p>
  <p><i>Mask</i><br>
 His mask is part soldier and part 'good slave'. As the representative of the military, he has a dark complexion and curly, perfumed hair that moves about. <br>
 As a bonus servus, he has a trumpet mouth, bulbous eyes and reddish hair. His brows are symmetrical and he has a snub nose</p>
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  <p><i>Humour</i><br>
 Harpax is a bonus servus who wants to be a miles. He is highly 'bonded' to his work, dogged in pursuit of his duty, and determined to carry out his instructions to the letter. Proud of his military life, he is insolent to a mere civilian slave (Pseudolus) but respectful and precise to his superiors, Ballio and Simo (at least until they impugn his virility and dignity).</p>
  
  <p><b>Table of Key Plautine Personae, Listing Evidence for Masks, Physicality, Costumes and Props </b></p>
  <p>The following table is a work in progress, a provisional model which does not claim to include all the available evidence. Nor does it cover all character types in Plautus. It should be regarded as an 'assemblage' of evidence collected by various scholars, and as one of the bases upon which the 'The Masks of Pseudolus' have been constructed. </p>
  <p>Looking for evidence of ancient performance is a project of 'theatre archaeology' as described by Pearson and Shanks (2001). What we 'find' is inevitably conditioned by not only what has survived, but also where one looks, the way in which one looks, and by who is doing the looking. The evidence is fragmentary, often illusive and contradictory. It 'always has a multiple identity. Objects as clues are inherently unstable' [Pearson &amp; Shanks, 2001, 61]. The existential condition of such a search is always one of interpretation, reconstruction and recontextualisation. It is an assemblage of fragments which attempts to represent past activities rather than record them accurately. Julian Thomas (1994, 158) describes archaeology as involving 'the production of narratives which stand for the past, rather than constituting faithful replicas of the past'. The documentation of performance practice (which is always 'in the past') therefore involves a degree of <i>poesis</i>, a creative leap of the imagination whose feet nevertheless strive to remain rooted in the remains of the past. </p>
  <p>This is what I have done with 'The Masks of Pseudolus', and the remains of the past, or rather some of the clues, are collated in this table. I have also drawn on four productions of Plautine comedy - <i>Menaechmi</i>, <i>Mostellaria</i>, <i>Casina </i>and <i>Miles Gloriosus </i>- three of which I directed, and all of which I performed in as servus <i>callidus</i>. All but the <i>Miles </i>were performed in Latin, and for all we used masks, costumes, props and physicalities such as are described in this table and shown here. </p>
  <p>Sources for the Table: Pollux (IV.118-20) Donatus (On Comedy, VIII.6-7), Wiles 1991, 75-77, 151-87, 188-220; Saunders, 1966; Bieber, 1961; Webster <i>et al</i>, 1995, vol.1, 1-5; the visual evidence in their collection; and the playtexts of Plautus.</p>
  <p>A note on Costume: all actors wore notional &quot;Greek&quot; dress, consisting of body tights to represent naked flesh, with long sleeves and legs, which might be brown, yellow or other colours. The <i>chiton </i>was a long or short tunic, and the <i>pallium</i>, or <i>himation</i>, a simple rectangular cloth which was wrapped around the body. It was then taken over the right shoulder and over the left forearm, leaving the left hand poking out. No pins or broaches were used. Trailing the <i>pallium </i>behind on the ground might indicate either decadence or self-neglect. Bright cloths signified happiness, worn-out cloths were for those in hardship. Purple signified wealth. </p>
  <p>A note on Physicality: the evidence suggests that demonstrative hand movements were common. In 'real life' the body in equilibrium was a sign of free status and decorum, imbalance or distortion a sign of slavery either actual or 'moral'. But on the stage some of these forms were reversed or exaggerated. Whole body forms rather than isolations are suggested.
