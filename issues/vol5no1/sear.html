 The University of Melbourne Roman theatres project: reality and virtual reality</p>
  <p>The paper discusses the University of Melbourne project and the theatres it has been surveying over the last few years, including Gubbio, Taormina, Orange, Jerash and Benevento. The findings are discussed using slides and it is then shown how in recent years the surveys have been used to produce computer visualisations of the buildings. Visualisations will be shown of the South Theatre at Jerash and the theatre at Beneventum.<br>
