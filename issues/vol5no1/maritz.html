  <p>Recent studies have examined the tradition of Greek drama in many countries, including South Africa, but until recently little has been done in in this field in Rhodesia/Zimbabwe. This paper looks at the performance of both tragedy and comedy in Rhodesia/Zimbabwe during this century. It considers the choice of play, the translation used, the occasion and details of performance. It also looks at the political context, the changes that occurred at Independence and the relevance of the art form. It tries tp assess the significance of Greek drama in an Africa context in central Africa during the 20th century.</p>
