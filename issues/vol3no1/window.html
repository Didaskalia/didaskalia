  <p>DETAILS:</p>
  <p><i>Clouds</i> is a rambunctious musical comedy about Socrates and his fanatical<br>
 students in Ancient Athens. While skewering modern university education,<br>
 this preposterous play features irreverent parodies of popular songs from<br>
 Gilbert and Sullivan, Mozart, Verdi, Bellini, Handel, and Slovenian polkas.<br>
 At the Athenian Festival of Dionysos in 423 B.C., Clouds won 3rd prize (out<br>
 of 3 plays), but Robic's bold and innovative production captured the Best<br>
 Director Award at the 1995 University of Toronto Drama Festival.</p>

  <p>THEATRON CD-ROM</p>
  <p>Researchers based at the University of Warwick are preparing an extensive<br>
 computer-based collection of theatre-historical material. Their work is<br>
 centred on a consortium called THEATRON (Theatre History of Europe:<br>
 Architectural and Textual Resources On-line), a collaboration between<br>
 Warwick's Department of Theatre Studies, Berlin Architects GMW Partnership,<br>
 ABACUS (Architecture and Building Aids Computer Unit Strathclyde), and other<br>
 colleagues. The project is preparing extensive data-sets including a large<br>
 number of computer animated designs of historic theatres; a visual archives<br>
 of theatre- based artifacts; and collections of critical and dramatic texts.<br>
 The Consortium will be making its work available in a series of educational<br>

  <p>Archive of Performances of Greek and Roman Drama</p>
  <p>The Archive of Performances of Greek and Roman Drama is to be established in<br>
 Oxford under the Joint Directorship of Dr Edith Hall (Somerville College)<br>
 and Dr Oliver Taplin (Magdalen College). The Leverhulme Trust has made a<br>
 grant to cover the employment of a full-time Researcher (or possibly two<br>
 part-time Researchers) for three years. The Archive will be accomodated, for<br>
 the time being, in the European Humanities Research Centre at 37A St Giles,<br>
 Oxford OX1 3LD. Numbers for telephone, fax, e-mail, etc. will be available<br>
 shortly. The Researcher(s) should be appointed in early July 1996 to start<br>
 work by October 1996.</p>
  <p>The central task of the Archive will be to accumulate and make a database of<br>
 all available documentation of all productions in any country throughout the<br>
 world from the Renaissance to the present day. Documentation will include<br>
 texts (especially prompt books, etc.), publicity, programmes, reviews,<br>
 reports, films, videos and other sorts of recording. While the surviving<br>
 tragedies and comedies of Greece and Rome will form the core of the Archive,<br>
 there will obviously be some extension into, for example, performances of<br>
 non-dramatic works, performances in antiquity, and into other related<br>
 productions, including operas, plays and films which are based on or<br>
 inspired by Greek and Roman drama.</p>
  <p>It is one of our first tasks to build up an extensive international network<br>
 of contacts. This will be, in the first instance, for the accumulation of<br>
 material, but we also intend, among other activities, to hold a large<br>
 international meeting, probably in 1998. Fuller announcements and details<br>
 will be broadcast in due course. In the meantime, the Joint Directors would<br>
 be grateful for any suggestions, names of possible contacts, etc.</p>
