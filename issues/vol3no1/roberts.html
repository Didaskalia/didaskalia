  <h3><em>*Antigone*</em> by Sophokles</h3>

  <p>In March this year Prof. Michael Ewans directed the premiere season of his <br>
 own new English translation of *Antigone* by Sophokles, for the forthcoming complete Sophokles in the Everyman Classics series. The play was presented in the Newcastle University Drama Studio, where a half- size model of the ancient Greek orchestra was re-created, with the audience seating around three-quarters of the circle. The size of the theatre permitted only three tiers of seating, but the space was both panoramic and intimate. The *skene* consisted of a dishevelled stone building with central doors; only a coil of barbed wire broke the illusion of antiquity.</p>
  <p>Despite the suggestion of the authentic Greek theatre, a decision had been <br>
 made to use lighting, out of necessary practicalities and as an unobtrusive <br>
 assistance to the modern audience, so accustomed to this device. The <br>
 Director's goal seemed to be to stay within the realms of authenticity until <br>
 it interfered with the modern audience's ability to experience *Antigone* in the spirit in which it was originally written.</p>
  <p>This production was set in Sarajevo in modern times, a plausible location<br>
 for such a tragic and violent play. This context gave the modern audience a valid framework for the heightened emotions and passion expressed by the cast and the graphic bloodshed unavoidable in war (and not untypical of Prof. Ewans' productions). As a Muslim society, Sarajevo gave a legitimate modern setting to the culturally accepted powerlessness of women, which is an important challenge to the internal strength of Antigone and the basis for Ismene's belief 'that we were born female/ so we can't fight men'.</p>
  <p>Talent was distributed evenly throughout the cast, drawn principally from <br>
 students of the Departments of Classics and Drama, with the actors credibly cast in their roles. Helen Atkinson, who played the title role, is a petite young woman, who rose to the challenge of subverting the traditional stereotype of a Greek tragic heroine, without the overkill that would lose her the empathy of the audience. She gave an emotionally fearless performance that set the pitch for the other characters.</p>
  <p>Kreon, played by Tom Bonjekovic as a middle-aged, leather-jacketed <br>
 warlord rather than the traditional patriarch, was a strong force in the <br>
 production; his was a passionate and enthusiastic performance. He was big <br>
 in his reactions, giving justification to the paranoid tendencies of Kreon, <br>
 and maintained a strong pace throughout the whole play, with even more <br>
 to give at the deaths of his household in the closing scene.</p>
  <p>Lauren Eade played Ismene as a true sisterly match to Antigone. She drew <br>
 empathy from the audience for Ismene's lack of courage but not at Antigone's expense.</p>
  <p>One of the most dynamic features of the play was the work done by the <br>
 Choros, the five councillors of the city. They were each different in height <br>
 and build, showing a lifelike diversity of the people they represented. <br>
 Although their routine was not always precisely executed, there was a <br>
 uniformity of spirit as they expressed the odes and one found oneself <br>
 waiting for their action or reappearance on stage. Christine Smith had <br>
 choreographed a fascinating blend of dance and rhythmic movement to <br>
 the Iranian folk music of Anouar Brahen. This, coupled with the unusual <br>
 dynamic of having five men thus engaged, was moving and added a rich <br>
 texture to the production.</p>
  <p>Prof. Ewans made some changes to his translation during rehearsal, to <br>
 give fluidity to the action. Initially one was conscious of the fact that the <br>
 speech was different from everyday language in its beauty, but the actors <br>
 were fluent in the script and the unfolding of the plot quickly became the <br>
 focus. As part of the audience one found oneself easily transported into <br>
 the story, which one may reasonably assume was a goal of Sophokles.</p>
  <p>It is not difficult to be enthusiastic about a production so creatively <br>
 directed. Prof. Ewans' obvious knowledge of ancient Greek theatre gave <br>
 him a confidence to utilise totally the benefits of the round stage in the <br>
 'free' movement of the actors. This unselfconscious blocking left <br>
 the actors with their backs to some of the audience, an almost inevitable <br>
 result of playing in the round, and one which gave each audience member <br>
 a unique perspective on the action. Ewans was able to take an almost <br>
 mythical story and revive it with poignancy. One looks forward to <br>
 his next venture (*Aias*, in March 1997).</p>
  <p>A video recording of the Newcastle production of *Antigone* will be <br>
 available, in both PAL and NTSC formats, from late June. Enquiries and <br>
 orders can be sent to Prof. Michael Ewans, Dept of Drama, University of <br>
 Newcastle NSW Australia. </p>
