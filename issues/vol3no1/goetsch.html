  <p>The words 'This production contains material of a sexual nature' are, of <br>
 course, something of an understatement when they refer to <em>Lysistrata</em>. <br>
 Practical Passion gave its audience a cheerfully explicit rendition of this <br>
 comedy in which there is very little material which is <em>not</em> of a sexual <br>
 nature.</p>
  <p>The Court House in Warwick now houses the Tourist Information Centre <br>
 and very little else, as repeated vandalism has caused such luxury items as <br>
 public telephones to be removed. Theatergoers entering the lavatories were <br>
 advised that 'Those who use these premises for recreational purposes do so <br>
 at their own risk.' The high-ceilinged hall in which the performance took <br>
 place had a dignified look to it, with pink granite pilasters and two <br>
 enormous fireplaces (non-functioning, of course), but the cursive lettering <br>
 over the door assured us that the room was licensed for singing and <br>
 dancing.</p>
  <p>The set was simple but effective, its staggered flats providing numerous <br>
 exits and entrances to the <em>skene</em>, with blocks and platforms to allow the <br>
 women to appear above the men when necessary. In good authentic <br>
 fashion, the <em>skene</em> was the locus of the numerous costume changes <br>
 required in this relentlessly modern-dress production. The lighting <br>
 instruments (nor more than four or five) were mounted on tripods at the <br>
 back of the room. The production, which played earlier this month in <br>
 Leamington Spa and Banbury, was well-designed for portability.</p>
  <p>Unfortunately, the seating was not well-designed for visibility. The chairs <br>
 which notices requested us not to drag across the floor were comfortable <br>
 enough, but did not provide a very good view of anything which happened <br>
 at floor level. And the acoustics were disastrous, a fact impossible to ignore <br>
 given that most of the music used was recorded.</p>
  <p>The production began with an unscripted piece of choreography to loud <br>
 house music: <em>Lysistrata: The Rock Video</em>. It seemed at first that this <br>
 dance was intended to illustrate the battle of the sexes, but its connection <br>
 with the play became less clear as it went on. It did serve to focus our <br>
 attention.</p>
  <p>Most members of this company are university-age at the oldest (there was <br>
 one boy of about ten), but Lysistrata herself was played by an attractive, <br>
 dynamic woman in her forties, making her a far more substantial character <br>
 than the other women in their baby-doll dresses and pigtails, who exuded a <br>
 remarkable innocence in spite of their obvious randiness. She had a <br>
 confident presence which survived her occasional calls to the prompter, <br>
 who stood ready behind the doors with a marked-up copy of the Penguin <br>
 Miniature Classic. Despite substantial cuts, the production was quite faithful <br>
 to the text.</p>
  <p>Lampito was portrayed as a Scots Valkyrie, with doorstop-springs at the <br>
 ends of her conical 'breasts'. It's common practice for English translators to <br>
 use Scots dialect to translate the regional accents of Greece. Sommerstein <br>
 certainly does, but none of the actors attempted the accent, though the <br>
 Spartan characters were all festooned with clashing tartans, right down to <br>
 the plaid erection of the Spartan herald.</p>
  <p>Other amusing touches included the pump-action water pistols with which <br>
 the women defeated the men who were trying to burn them down and the <br>
 immense gold phallus which served to contain the initial 'sacrifice' of wine, <br>
 as well as the small cuddly toy sheep which was originally suggested as <br>
 victim. If Paul Atkins missed an opportunity for sexual innuendo, it was <br>
 only by cutting the Reconciliation Scene.</p>
  <p>After an interval which, if not entirely appropriate, was desperately <br>
 necessary due to the stuffy heat of the room on the first day which actually <br>
 felt like July, the cast resumed their places to the strains of 'Walk on the <br>
 Wild Side.' (Most of the recorded accompaniment was 1970s pop and rock, <br>
 though the chorus of men did a good job of rewriting the 'Philosophers' <br>
 Drinking Song.') The women wore pyjamas for the opening scene in which <br>
 they tried to escape the Acropolis, but returned to their baby-doll dresses for <br>
 Kinesias' scene with Myrrhine. Before Myrrhine's striptease act the <br>
 ensemble performed another original routine, this one on the theme of 'tell <br>
 me about your man,' though the poor acoustics rendered it nearly <br>
 unintelligible.</p>
  <p>By the finale the women had slid into slinky evening dresses and the general <br>
 revelry included colorful sprays of confetti springs as well as conspicuous <br>
 consumption of alcohol--a proper <em>komos</em>. Though unquestionably an <br>
 amateur production, with occasional awkwardnesses of delivery and fluffed <br>
 lines, Practical Passion's <em>Lysistrata</em> is no village panto. Though one or <br>
 two audience members were shocked (one assumes) into leaving at the <br>
 interval, the rest laughed uproariously throughout and left in high spirits. <br>
 And that, after all, is what Aristophanes is about.</p>
