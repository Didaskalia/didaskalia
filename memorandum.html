<!--#include virtual="/inc/header.html" --><b>Memorandum 
  of Understanding between the Open University and <i>Didaskalia</i></b> 
   
  <br>
  <br>
  <p><b>Preamble</b><br>
 The Open University and <i>Didaskalia</i> recognise the close correspondences and overlap of interests between a number of their research, pedagogical and online activities relating to the reception of ancient drama. At present these activities are carried out independently. They agree that a new collaboration would offer valuable opportunities significantly to consolidate and expand the range and quality of each others' activities in certain areas. In particular, collaboration would assist the Classical Studies Department's Research project on the reception of classical texts and <i>Didaskalia</i> in linking high-quality research materials with high-profile, international scholarly and pedagogical outreach, and to foster exchange and growth of knowledge among students, researchers, academics, and theatre practitioners. Collaboration would offer <i>Didaskalia</i> a secure foundation for sustainable growth. The Reception of Classical Texts Research Project and <i>Didaskalia</i> would both be able to draw on each other's strengths in preparing and carrying out gmrant-funded research and teaching innovations, such as the JISC-funded ARCHES project (&pound;150k) in which <i>Didaskalia</i> is a currently participant, and the current and future projects of the Open University researchers. The Reception of Classical Texts Research Project and <i>Didaskalia</i> have therefore drawn up this Memorandum of Understanding. </p>
  <p><i>Didaskalia</i> is an international electronic journal for research in Greek and Roman drama and its reception and is the world leader in its field. In addition to publishing refereed articles and Special Editions, it contains Reviews, performance Listings, VR representations of the material environment of ancient theatre, an agora/forum area for discussion and a Study area. It is available freely on-line, currently at http://www.didaskalia.net.</p>
  <p><br>

  <p>1.1 From June 2003, or as soon as possible thereafter, <i>Didaskalia</i> will carry the Open University logo on its home page and elsewhere within the web-site as appropriate. It will also carry statements in appropriate locations within the website giving full recognition to the nature of the relationship with the OU. </p>
  <p>1.2 The Open University and <i>Didaskalia</i> will proactively work together to enhance the range and quality of each other's educational and scholarly resources, activities and profiles in concrete, demonstrable ways. The Editorial Board of <i>Didaskalia</i> will continue to have full academic independence in respect of publication of articles, special issues etc. The existing conventions for independent refereeing of articles submitted will continue to apply.</p>
  <p> <b>Representation</b><br>

The Editorial Board will normally include an Associate Director, a Listings Editor (contributed by the American Philological Association Committee on Ancient and Modern Performance), a Reviews Editor, an Education Editor, and such other Sub-Editors as the Editor may from time to time appoint. </p>
  <p>2.1 From June 2003, the Editorial Board of <i>Didaskalia </i>will also include an Academic Representative nominated by the OU Department of Classics. In the first instance, this person will be Professor Lorna Hardwick. The OU representative should be an <i>ex officio</i> member of the Board. The Education Editor should be appointed in consultation with the OU representative.</p>
  <p>2.2 The Editor and the OU Academic Representative in consultation with the Editorial Board will agree a Development Plan, to be reviewed and updated annually. The Development Plan will outline the duties of the Administrator, Web-Editor and such additional Web-Development as may be agreed, taking into consideration the requirements of collaborative projects between the Open University, <i>Didaskalia </i>and/or other partners. </p>
  <p><b>Technical Infrastructure</b><br>
 3.0 From June 2003, or as soon thereafter as practicable, <i>Didaskalia </i>will be transferred to an Open University server, and relocated to a URL within the OU domain, e.g. www.didaskalia.open.ac.uk. </p>
  <p>3.1 The OU will undertake to give reasonable cooperation and necessary technical access during the period of handover to the <i>Didaskalia </i>server to any persons nominated, and named in advance, by the Editor to carry out web-editing, web-development or other work as determined by the Editor. <br>
 <br>
 3.2 The OU will undertake to give reasonable cooperation and necessary technical access to external bodies nominated by the Editor and approved by the OU, in order to carry out, for example, grant-funded projects, the preparation of study resources, the creation / modification of interactive resources, or new issues of the Journal, subject to the staffing resources and infrastructure set out in 4 below.<br>
 <br>
 <b>Staffing and Management Infrastructure<br>
 </b>4.0 From October 2003, the Open University will assume the cost of routine web-editing and web-development and occasional web-development as defined under Roles and Responsibilities below to carry out the programme of work devised in consultation with the OU Academic Representative in the annual Development Plan (2.3 above). <br>
 <br>
 4.1 For an interim period of approximately one year (until October 2003), web-editing will primarily be carried out, as at present, by a nominee of the Editor, externally to the OU, and funded to a maximum of &pound;1,200 by the University of Warwick. In the course of 2003, this person will gradually be phased out as a person appointed by the OU is phased in.<br>
 <br>
 4.2 From October 2003, the OU will provide staff for routine web-editing and day-to-day administration of <i>Didaskalia</i>, amounting to a total of 0.2 FTE. (These two roles may be assumed by the same person.) The Web-editor and Administrator, who will usually be based in the OU Reception of Classical Texts Research Project, will be managed by the OU Academic Representative or the Director of Reception of Classical Texts Research Project (if he/she is not the OU Academic Representative). <br>
 <br>
 4.3 <i>Didaskalia</i> may participate in grant-funded, collaborative projects, such as the JISC-funded ARCHES project (October 2002 - September 2004) necessitating web-editing, administration, and web-development to be undertaken by partners external to the Open University but channelled through the OU web admin. <i>Didaskalia</i> will contribute to such projects &quot;in association with the Open University&quot; and the Open University will be given full credit for its participation through <i>Didaskalia</i>. The Open University will not be responsible for providing additional funding for any work generated by the JISC-funded ARCHES project.<br>
