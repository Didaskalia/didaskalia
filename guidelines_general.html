<h1 class="page_title">Guidelines for  Submissions</h1>
<h2>Editorial Policy: Articles</h2>
<p><em>Didaskalia</em> is a  peer-reviewed journal that publishes scholarly articles in English on the  performance of Greek and Roman drama, dance, and music.  Contributors to <em>Didaskalia</em> should use as little jargon as possible and write for a  knowledgeable audience of students, devotees, scholars, and practitioners of  ancient performance.  We value the  individual voices of our authors within the broad limits of professional writing  style. We discourage articles that are personal accounts of a production unless  they serve a particular analytical or theoretical thesis.  </p>
<p>We reserve the right to make such revisions as are necessary  to maintain the journal's standards of quality.   Edited files are returned to the author for  approval of changes before publication. </p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<h2>Editorial Policy: Views</h2>
<p><em>Didaskalia</em> also  publishes other sorts of pieces on current productions in our Views section:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Reviews</strong> of productions and books, which have their own <a href="guidelines_reviews.html"><strong>guidelines</strong></a>.</li>
  <li><strong>Previews</strong>, <strong>Interviews</strong>, and <strong>Views</strong>, which are new categories with evolving <a href="guidelines_other.html"><strong>submission guidelines</strong></a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Items for the Views sections can be less formal than  articles, but will still be edited to meet our standards of quality.</p>
<p>If you have doubts about where in <em>Didaskalia</em> your submission belongs, please consult with the  editors.</p>
<h2>Format</h2>
<p>Please submit only one version of your text, as an attached  document in Rich Text Format (.rtf), Plain Text (.txt), or Microsoft Word (.doc  or .docx).</p>
<p>Greek should remain in the Greek alphabet (polytonic Greek  unicode).</p>
<p>In most cases, authors should provide translations of any  non-English text.</p>
<p>If the text includes images, please submit them separately  as high quality jpeg files and indicate where they should appear in the text.  For audio files, please submit in mp3 format.   For video, several digital formats are acceptable.  Please inquire for posting instructions.</p>
<h2>Style and  Documentation</h2>
<p>Authors in the United States and its possessions are asked  to follow the standards of the <em>Chicago  Manual of Style</em> and <em>Merriam-Webster’s  Collegiate Dictionary</em> in matters of style, usage, and documentation. Either  the “notes-and-bibliography” or the “author-date” system of documentation is  acceptable. Authors in other countries may follow the <em>Oxford Style Manual </em>if they prefer to do so. For ease of editing,  please use one of the common fonts and double spaces between lines.</p>
<h2>Where to send your  work</h2>
<p>Contributions should be submitted by e-mail to <strong>&#101;&#100;&#105;&#116;&#111;&#114;&#64;&#100;&#105;&#100;&#97;&#115;&#107;&#97;&#108;&#105;&#97;&#46;&#110;&#101;&#116;</strong>.  If you have large image or video files to  submit, please email the editor, and we’ll make arrangements.</p>
