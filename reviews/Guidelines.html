  for Listings Editors 
  <p><b>General Notes</b></p>
  <p> 
  <li> Listings are given in reverse chronological order (i.e. with the most recent first).<br>
  
  <li> Dates always refer to date of first performance.<br>
  
  <li> Review files are saved to the Reviews folder, and named as follows: YYMMDD##, where ## is the file number for that date. (e.g. The review file for a production opening on 12 August 2001 will be: 01081201.html. A second production opening on the same date will be 01081202.html.)<br>
  
  <li>The &quot;from&quot; date on the Past Productions Index page, and at the top of each Past Productions Page corresponds to the earliest date of first performance listed on that page.<br>
  
  <li> When a Past Productions Page acquires c.10 items, it is 'closed' and a new page opened and added to the Past Productions Index.</li>
