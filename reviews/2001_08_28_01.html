  <p><b>D.C. Theaters Open With Greek Plays</b><br>

 The 

 New York Times, August 25, 2001

  <p>WASHINGTON (AP) -- Director Michael Kahn of the Shakespeare 

 Theatre says he has always thought that plays by ancient Greeks about 

 their myths and legends resemble the way Africans treat their own prehistory.</p>

  <p>Khan and his crew open their 15th season Tuesday with 

 an Africanized version of Sophocles' Oedipus trilogy, with an all-black 

 cast and a chanting, dancing chorus. ``The Greek chorus chanted and 

 danced too,'' Kahn said. ``It's our job to make it intelligible to the 

 audience.''</p>

  <p>Kahn has squeezed <i>The Oedipus Plays</i> into a single 

 evening to tell the story of the tragic hero who inadvertently killed 

 his father and married his mother.</p>

  <p>Arena Stage, another of Washington's leading theaters, 

 opens its season Aug. 31 with <i>Agamemnon and His Daughters</i>, combining 

 six plays by three playwrights: Aeschylus, Euripides and Sophocles.</p>

  <p>Adaptor Kenneth Cavander's production tells the story 

 of the legendary king who led the Greeks in the Trojan war.</p>

  <p>Molly Smith, Arena's artistic director, said, ``The 

 recurring themes of ambition, revenge, courage, retribution, sacrifice 

 and forgiveness also make it surprisingly Washingtonian.''</p>

  <p>Neither theater has staged an ancient Greek play before 

 -- not Arena, in 51 years, nor the Shakespeare, in 15. Kahn and Smith 

 said their choice of season openers was a coincidence. After it was 

 discovered, Smith said, they agreed that Washington could use a double 

 dose of Greek tragedy. They will have a chance to explain why at a public 

 symposium to be held at the Shakespeare Theatre next month.</p>

  <p>Cavander said almost everything in his adaptation comes 

 from a Greek original that he translated. He started studying ancient 

 Greek when he was 12 and writing poetry in it at 19.</p>

  <p>The Shakespeare Theatre troupe took a field trip to 

 Zimbabwe to prepare for their <i>Oedipus</i>. Kahn said the trip taught 

 him about how Africans actively express grief, compared with Westerners' 

 more subdued grieving.</p>

  <p>The group spent much of their 10-day African visit watching 

 dances and rituals of the Shona and Ndebele tribes. <i>The Oedipus Plays</i> 

 features music by an American, Baikida Carroll, which will be played 

 by a three-man band on a variety of African instruments, including drums, 

 conch shells, an African harp and the tambour, an Egyptian guitar. One 

 of the three musicians comes from Ghana.</p>
