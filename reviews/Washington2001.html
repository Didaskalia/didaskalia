  <p><b>D.C. Theaters Open With Greek Plays</b></p>
  <p>WASHINGTON (AP) -- Director Michael Kahn of the Shakespeare Theatre
 says he has always thought that plays by ancient Greeks about their
 myths and legends resemble the way Africans treat their own
 prehistory.</p>
  <p>Khan and his crew open their 15th season Tuesday with an Africanized
 version of Sophocles' Oedipus trilogy, with an all-black cast and a
 chanting, dancing chorus. ``The Greek chorus chanted and danced
 too,'' Kahn said. ``It's our job to make it intelligible to the
 audience.''</p>
  <p>Kahn has squeezed <i>The Oedipus Plays</i> into a single evening to tell the story of the tragic hero who inadvertently killed his father and married his mother.</p>
  <p>Arena Stage, another of Washington's leading theaters, opens its season Aug. 31 with <i>Agamemnon and His Daughters</i>, combining six plays by three playwrights: Aeschylus, Euripides and Sophocles.</p>
  <p>Adaptor Kenneth Cavander's production tells the story of the
 legendary king who led the Greeks in the Trojan war.</p>
  <p>Molly Smith, Arena's artistic director, said, ``The recurring themes
 of ambition, revenge, courage, retribution, sacrifice and forgiveness
 also make it surprisingly Washingtonian.''</p>
  <p>Neither theater has staged an ancient Greek play before -- not Arena,
 in 51 years, nor the Shakespeare, in 15. Kahn and Smith said their
 choice of season openers was a coincidence. After it was discovered,
 Smith said, they agreed that Washington could use a double dose of
 Greek tragedy. They will have a chance to explain why at a public
 symposium to be held at the Shakespeare Theatre next month.</p>
  <p>Cavander said almost everything in his adaptation comes from a Greek
 original that he translated. He started studying ancient Greek when
 he was 12 and writing poetry in it at 19.</p>
  <p>The Shakespeare Theatre troupe took a field trip to Zimbabwe to prepare for their <i>Oedipus</i>. Kahn said the trip taught him about how Africans actively express grief, compared with Westerners' more subdued grieving.</p>
  <p>The group spent much of their 10-day African visit watching dances and rituals of the Shona and Ndebele tribes. <i>The Oedipus Plays</i>
 features music by an American, Baikida Carroll, which will be played by a three-man band on a variety of African instruments, including drums, conch shells, an African harp and the tambour, an Egyptian guitar. One of the three musicians comes from Ghana.</p>
