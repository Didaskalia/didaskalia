He has also taught as a visiting professor at Yale and the University of Califoria, and worked as a Resident Scholar at the J.

He is an authority on ancient theatre, and has written two major studies of theatre and spectacles in ancient Rome: <a

  <p>Professor Beacham is also the English language authority on the work of the early twentieth century theatre designer and visionary theoretician, Adolphe Appia, on whom he has published four books, and numerous articles, including <em>Adolphe Appia, Theatre Artist</em> (Cambridge Press), <a

  <p>He is currently conducting leading research in the application of advanced information technology, and in particular the use of Virtual Reality, to the research and teaching of historic theatre sites and stage setting. </p>
  <p>This work has been supported by the Heritage Division of the Council of Europe, and in addition, Prof. Beacham recently secured a major conservation grant from the Getty Trust, arising from this work, which has also received support from a wide variety of international funding bodies.</p>
  <p>Prof. Beacham heads the recently completed million pound EC-sponsored <a href="http://www.theatron.org" target="_blank">THEATRON</a> project (Theatre History in Europe: Architectural and Texual Resources Online), which is a consortium of 8 European academic and commercial partners, who are creating an advanced multi-media teaching and research module documenting the history of European theatre. This module uses a virtual reality interface to access a great many 3D architectural models of major European historic theatres linked to supporting textual and graphic databases.</p>
