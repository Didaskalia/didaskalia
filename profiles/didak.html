  <p><strong><b>So what about me ?</b></strong> </p>
  <p>I'm both a software engineer and computer animator and have been able to combine the best of both worlds. It has been almost six years since I formed my own business, Animagic, which specializes in 3D computer graphics for broadcast design. Alongside this, development of software also played a major role. Currently the development and production departments are seperated due to the confusion created by our extensive list of services. The development department is currently developing IPAS routines for 3D Studio and in-house proprietary tools for both the PC and the Silicon Graphics platforms. It has been five wonderful years, and with the current state of progress the next five years will be even better in terms of new development.</p>
  <p><strong><b>Computing Background</b> </strong></p>
  <font

  <p>I started with computer graphics back in late 1985, when the Commodore Amiga computers were first introduced. This is where I got my first taste of computer graphics and animations, with a package called Videoscape from Aegis. By today's standards this package would be a real old-timer where 3D geometry had to be entered by hand (coordinates and polygons) in ASCII. Back in those days creating a twenty-second animation took about a month of work. Today, of course, this can be done in a few hours :) I've been able to follow the evolution in the computer graphics industry from that point on, and quickly started to do some expirimental raytracing with the Amiga port of DBW Render. About four years ago I switched to bigger and better platforms and software (and never regretted it).</p>

  <font

  size="2"> 
  <p>It was 15 Oct 1994 when I got in contact with Sallie Goetsch about a product Animagic has been planning and working on for stage and lighting design. Shortly after that we both got involved discussing various aspects of our respective 'industries,' looking at possibilities for combining the two so the advantages of computer graphics and visualization could be used as a teaching tool. We are now working on creating an animated reconstruction of the Theater of Dionysus at Athens as a proof project for an interactive software package on ancient theaters.</p>
