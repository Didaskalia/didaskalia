  Hugh 
  Denard lectures in the <a href="http://www.kcl.ac.uk/humanities/cch/">Centre for Computing in the Humanities</a>, King's College, London, where he convenes the MA in Digital Culture and Technology and is Associate Director of the <a href="http://www.kvl.cch.kcl.ac.uk/">King's Visualisation Lab</a>. He directs a JISC-funded project to establish a Support Network for academics using 3D visualisation technologies in the Arts and Humanities, and is co-director of an AHRC-funded ICT Methods project designed to develop &quot;a methodology for tracking and documenting the cognitive process in 3-dimensional visualisation-based research.&quot; He has been Editor of <em>Didaskalia </em>since 2000. </p>
  <p>Hugh read Drama and Classical Civilizations at Trinity College Dublin, before going on to take an MA in Ancient Drama and Society (Classics) at the University of Exeter. His doctorate (Drama), on modern reworkings of Greek Tragedy, concentrated on versions of Sophoclean drama by Seamus Heaney and Tom Paulin for Field Day Theatre Company. Following the completion of his Ph.D., he taught in the English Department at Trinity College Dublin for a year, and then in the School of Theatre at the University of Warwick, specialising in ancient Greek and Roman drama and 
  its influence. He moved, with the other members of the visualisation research group, to King's College, London, in September 2005. </p>
  <p>Hugh is a member of the research team for <a href="http://www.pompey.cch.kcl.ac.uk/">The Pompey Project</a>, an ongoing project to study and digitally to 
  reconstruct Rome's earliest stone theatre, and jointly directs a theatre-historical programme of research that uses advanced visualisation techniques to explore 'theatrical' aspects of Pompeian frescos and Roman domestic environments. Hugh was also Joint Academic Director of <a href="http://www.warwick.ac.uk/ETS/arches/">ARCHES</a>, a two-year programme of work at the University of Warwick funded by JISC to create and embed in a range of innovative teaching projects a new, freely-available online database of visual resources 
  relating to ancient drama, now <a href="../studyarea/visual_resources/visualresources.html">available</a> through <em>Didaskalia</em> (see the article by <a href="../issues/vol6no2/childs.htm">Mark Childs</a> in Issue 6 Volume 2). The visualisation group's work has been supported by public funding from the ARHB, British Academy, HEFCE (SRIF), JISC, Leverhulme Foundation and a number of internal, university grants. </p>
