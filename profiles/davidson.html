  <p><b><strong>For the record</strong></b></p>
  <p>I graduated from Victoria University of Wellington. Then I completed a doctorate at London (1969) on Sophocles, my supervisors being first T.B.L. Webster and then E.W. Handley. I've been in the Classics Department (now the Classics Programme of the School of Art History, Classics and Religious Studies) at VUW since August 1969, would you believe it!! I was appointed to the Chair in Classics in August 2003. I've published lots of articles on Sophocles in particular, the staging of Greek tragedy, and some classical features of modern N.Z. drama. I'm also avidly interested in the theatre in general and have acted as advisor for a number of local Wellington productions of ancient plays. At the moment, as far as research goes, I'm heavily into myth as well as continuing various projects on Greek tragedy.</p>
