  <h3>Why I got into this</h3>
  <p> Ancient theatre has been an interest of mine since secondary school. During the course of my graduate work at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, I became increasingly convinced of the importance of performance as a tool for research into Greek and Roman drama. Performance also provides a means of bringing Classics to a wider audience and offers actors the opportunity to develop skills which will serve them well in any genre. Greek and Roman tragedy and comedy remain some of the most vital, fascinating, and moving theatre available on the modern stage and continue to attract both audiences and critical attention. </p>
  <h3>A very brief resume</h3>
  <p> Beginning while I was in graduate school at the University of Michigan, I spent several years acting as translator, producer, dramaturg, or director to productions of Greek and Roman plays. I have taught ancient theatre at the secondary and university level and lectured in the US, the UK, and Ireland. I spent four years at the University of Warwick teaching part time in Classics and Theatre Studies. In 1998 my health forced me to retire from teaching. I became a visiting scholar at the University of California at Berkeley, which I still am, though I visit rarely and scholar even less these days. </p>
  <p>By 2001 my health had improved substantially, and I went into business for myself as The FileSlinger, providing a variety of services, including editing and web design, for small businesses. It's a very different world, but I enjoy it and find a lot of opportunities for creativity.</p>
  <h3>Founding Didaskalia</h3>
  <p> At Oliver Taplin's suggestion and in cooperation with Ian Worthington and Peter Toohey, the then editors of Electronic Antiquity, I founded Didaskalia late in 1993, at which time the journal was archived at the University of Tasmania under the supervision of Ian Worthington. In December of 1994 Ian passed this responsibility on to me and we transferred Didaskalia to Warwick and expanded into hypertext format with the generous assistance of Computing Services at Warwick. In 1998, when I left Warwick for UC Berkeley, Didasklia was moved to an NT web server there with assistance from John Wuorenmaa of Cal's Information Technology Services. An 'archive' copy of the journal as it was then is still available at http://didaskalia.berkeley.edu; I use it as part of my professional portfolio.</p>
  <h3>What I did as Managing Editor</h3>
  <p> Once I had undertaken to start an electronic journal, I found myself responsible for the development and planning of the publication and for coordination of regional correspondents, and was the final but not sole authority in deciding what to publish. During my time as Managing Editor, the contents of Didaskalia were primarily either strictly informational (listings) or matters of opinion (reviews) and we did not need referees in the same way that a more academic publication does. I consulted the Editorial Board about policy decisions and revisions to articles prior to their publication. Toph Marshall, as Associate Editor, provided invaluable assistance, support, and motivation, as well as suggestions for how we should survive in the face of my decreasing ability to keep up.</p>
  <p>Fortunately, Hugh Denard was able to take over as Managing Editor in 2001, purchase a domain name, obtain funding, and establish Didaskalia as an independent entity. </p>
