  <p>Lorna Hardwick teaches in the Department of Classical Studies at the Open University, where she is Professor of Classical Studies and Director of the Research project on the <a href="http://www2.open.ac.uk/ClassicalStudies/GreekPlays/index.html">Reception of Greek texts and images in modern drama and poetry</a>. </p>
  <p>Her initial academic training was in Ancient History. She also studied European Literature and the History of Ideas and these fields came together to generate her interest in Reception Studies. Related publications include <i>Translating Words, Translating Cultures</i> (London, Duckworth, 2000) and <i>New Surveys in the Classics: Reception Studies</i> (Oxford, Oxford University Press, 2003). </p>
  <p>She convenes an international electronic seminar on the reception of Greek drama (February - May annually) and is currently working on the relationships between classical texts and their receptions in post-colonial drama and poetry.</p>
