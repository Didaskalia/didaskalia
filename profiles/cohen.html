  <p>Amy R. Cohen received a B.A. in Classics (Greek) at Yale University, and then a Ph.D. in Classics, with a minor in Comparative Literature, at Stanford University. Her doctoral work focused on the interpretive implications of doubling and the three-actor convention in Greek tragedy.</p>
  <p>Dr. Cohen teaches at Randolph-Macon Woman's College, where she has revived a cherished Greek Play tradition, directed by Mabel Kate Whiteside from 1909 to 1954. Starting with <em>Antigone</em> in 2000, and continuing in 2001 with <em>Iphigeneia at Aulis</em>, Cohen and her students present Greek plays as much as possible under original conventions: a single sex in all roles, three actors, a chorus that sings and dances, outdoors during daylight, and in a Greek theater with an orchestra much the size of the Theater of Dionysus. </p>
  <p>Apart from directing at R-MWC, Dr. Cohen's theatrical experience has included acting in college, directing children in a summer program, advising the Shotgun Players in Oakland, California, and being a member of the Board of Directors for Shenandoah Shakespeare in Staunton, Virginia.</p>
  <p>Directing the plays provides insight into the realities facing the ancient playwrights, and Dr. Cohen's research continues to argue that you cannot understand the plays without understanding how they were played.</p>
