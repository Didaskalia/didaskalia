<h1 class="page_title">Play Review Guidelines</h1>

<p>Reviews of performances should be 1000–5000 words and should  address the critical and creative choices behind the project reviewed.  Reviewers should take into account the  context of performance: the performers, the physical space, and the audience. Our  assumption is that any production of ancient drama, dance, or music has  something of value to tell the readers of <em>Didaskalia</em>,  but expectations and attendant aesthetic and critical decisions for long-run  professional shows are distinct from those for short-run college productions  and productions in other sorts of venues.  <em>Didaskalia</em> also concerns  itself with the interplay of ancient texts and conventions with modern scripts  and practice, welcoming discussion of a production’s decisions in historical  context.  </p>
<p>We encourage the use of video clips and photographs when  they are available.</p>
<p>Please see our <strong><a href="guidelines_general.html">General  Guidelines</a></strong> for points of style and format.</p><!--
<h2><em>Didaskalia</em> Review Honoraria</h2>
<p><em>Didaskalia</em> offers  a number of honoraria of $200 for reviewers of productions of ancient or  classically inspired theatre. Up to 20 total honoraria are available per year,  some of which will be directed to encourage reviews of productions in  out-of-the-way locations. Applications can be made to the Editor  (arcohen@didaskalia.net), indicating the details of the production, the dates  of the run, and (if relevant) the distance to be traveled. Applications may be  made either by the reviewer or by a production seeking to be reviewed.  Honoraria recipients are expected to produce a review of the production  suitable for publication in <em>Didaskalia</em>.  No individual may receive more than two honoraria in a single year.</p> -->
<h2>Book Reviews</h2>
<p>Book reviews should be 1000–5000 words and should evaluate a  book’s contribution to the understanding of the performance of ancient drama,  music, and dance.</p>
