  <i>Didaskalia</i> 
  <p><em>Didaskalia</em> is an English-language publication about Greek and Roman drama, dance, and music as they are performed today. The name <em>Didaskalia</em> is taken from the inscriptions used to record the outcomes of drama and music festivals in Athens. The need for records of productions is greater today than it was in Athens, because there is more Greek and Roman drama performed in more parts of the world than there ever was in antiquity.</p>
