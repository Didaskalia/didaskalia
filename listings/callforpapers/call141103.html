  The  dramatic surge of engagement with ancient drama by leading playwrights,  directors, and performers in recent years, has been reflected in the  range of national and international research initiatives in this area.  Projects such as the European Network of Research and Documentation  of Ancient Greek Drama Performances, the
  <st1:PersonName>Archive of Performances of Greek and Roman Drama</st1:PersonName>
  (Oxford), are  rapidly creating a new body of historical and theoretical work regarding  ancient drama in performance. This upsurge has also been marked by  the publication of important volumes such as <i>Translating Words, Translating Cultures </i>(Duckworth: 2000), <i>Medea in Performance,  1500-2000 (Oxford: 2000)</i>, <i>Dionysus Since 69 </i>(Oxford: 2003),  and by the creation of electronic initiatives such as the Reception  of the Texts and Images of Ancient Greece Project (Open University,  http://www2.open.ac.uk/ClassicalStudies/GreekPlays/) and the University  of Southern Queensland&rsquo;s <i>Playing with Tragedy</i> website (http://playingwithtragedy.usq.edu.au/).</p>
 <p>
  <o:p>
  Since  its inception in 1994, <i>Didaskalia</i> has played a significant  role in this rapidly growing area. Contributions are now sought for  three issues of <i>Didaskalia</i> to be published in the course of  2004, which will take stock of contemporary trends in the research  and performance of ancient drama. </p>
 <p>
  <o:p>
  Issue  1 (February) will consist of a survey of current research. Issue 2  (April) will review electronic initiatives in the field. Issue 3 (November)  will survey the breadth of current approaches to ancient drama in  performance, as well as placing observable trends within an historical  context.</p>

  <i>Didaskalia</i> is a peer-reviewed electronic journal and study resource dedicated  to the study of ancient Greek and Roman drama and its reception. Since October 2005, <i>Didaskalia </i>has been published in association  with King's College, London. </p>
 <p>
  <o:p>
  Recent  issues include articles and panel discussions with leading scholars  and practitioners on John Barton&rsquo;s <i>Tantalus</i>, Sophocles&rsquo; <i>Electra </i>in performance, and a multimedia, online supplement to <i>DRAMA</i> 12 (Ed. John Barsby, <i>Greek and Roman Drama: Translation and Performance, </i>Stuttgart and Weimar: 2002). </p>
 <p>
  <o:p>
  The  web-format of <i>Didaskalia </i>allows it to provide a shared, international  forum in which researchers, practitioners and students of ancient  drama can interact more swiftly and in new ways.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>Issues of the <i>Journal </i>reach publication  in weeks of submission dates, rather than months or years, and are  often rich in multimedia content. </p>
 <p>
  <o:p>
  <i>Didaskalia </i>also publishes listings and reviews of forthcoming events and  productions related to ancient drama, a Study Area for students of  ancient drama, and online discussion groups for students, teachers,  researchers and practitioners (&lsquo;The Agora&rsquo;).</p>
 <p>
  <o:p>
  Reviews,  listings events and productions, and other contributions related to  ancient drama in performance are welcome at all times. </p>
