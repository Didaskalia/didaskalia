<h3 align="center" ><b>4<sup>th</sup> 
 Annual Postgraduate Symposium on Ancient Drama:<br>
 <em>Adaptations of Ancient Greek Drama</em><br>
 Call for Papers</b></h3>
We are happy to announce that the Fourth 
Annual Postgraduate Symposium is being organised by the Department of Drama and 
Theatre, Royal Holloway, University of London and the Archive of Performances 
of Greek and Roman Drama, University of Oxford. This two-day event will take 
place this year on Thursday, 17 June, at Royal Holloway, Egham and Friday, 18 
June at the Classics Centre, Oxford. </p> 
<h4 align="center" ><b>About the Symposium</b></h4>
<p '>The Annual Postgraduate Symposium focuses on the reception of ancient Greek 
 drama, emphasizing the vivid afterlife of the dramatic texts through the revisitings 
 of ancient tragedy and comedy by academics, playwrights and practitioners. In 
 previous years, speakers from a number of countries have given papers on miscellaneous 
 aspects of the reception of ancient Greek drama. Abstracts of the papers given 
 at the 1<sup>st</sup>, 2<sup>nd </sup>and 3<sup>rd</sup> Postgraduate Symposia 
 are accessible online at: <a
href="http://www.apgrd.ox.ac.uk/events/postsymp.htm">www.apgrd.ox.ac.uk/events/postsymp.htm</a> 
</p>
<p>This year's Symposium will focus on adaptations of ancient Greek tragedy and 
 comedy throughout the centuries from Roman times to the present day. Adaptation 
 is intended to cover a wide range of refigurations of the ancient material: 
 from translations and rewritings to productions for theatre, cinema, opera and 
 dance. Of particular interest are those that attract critical attention as more 
 open and imaginative elaborations of the original texts. </p>
It is hoped that Peter Brown, Edith Hall, Lorna Hardwick, Fiona Macintosh, Pantelis 
Michelakis, Oliver Taplin and David Wiles will be present. </p> 
<h4 align="center" ><b>Participants </b></h4>
<p '>Postgraduates from across the globe who are working on revivals and adaptations 
 of Greek drama are welcome to participate. The Symposium is open to speakers 
 from different disciplines, including researchers in the fields of classics, 
 language or theatre studies. Practitioners are more than welcome to contribute 
 their personal experience of working on ancient drama. Papers can also be followed 
 by demonstrations, and there are different theatrical spaces available at Royal 
 Holloway for such purposes. </p>
<p '>Those who wish to offer either a paper or a performance on the theme of 'Adaptations 
 of Ancient Greek Drama' are invited to send an abstract of up to 400 words outlining 
 the proposed subject of their discussion to both <a href="mailto:eleftheria.ioanniou@classics.ox.ac.uk">eleftheria.ioannidou@classics.ox.ac.uk</a> 
 and <a
href="mailto:eleftheria.dagonaki@classics.ox.ac.uk">eleftheria.dagonaki@classics.ox.ac.uk</a> 
 <b>by Friday 26 March 2004 at the latest</b>. Please include details of your 
 current course of study, supervisor and academic institution.  </p>
<p '>There will be no registration fee, but participants will have to seek their 
 own funding to cover travel and accommodation expenses. Undergraduates are very 
 welcome to attend. </p>
