New Editor-in-Chief of <em>Didaskalia</em> appointed!</p>

<p>Dr Jane Montgomery Griffiths has been appointed Editor in Chief of Didaskalia. Jane, who lectures in Classical Studies at Monash University, Australia, is a specialist in Greek drama in contemporary performance. She has combined academic teaching and research in the UK and Australia with professional performance practice as an award winning actor and director in the UK in over forty professional productions. Jane is no stranger to Didaskalia, having authored no fewer than two articles and co-edited two issues of the Journal: "Complex Electra" Vol.5 Issue 3 (with Jennifer Wallace, 2002) and "Close Relations: the spaces of Greek and Roman performance" (with Paul Monaghan, forthcoming)."</p>

				<i>Call For Papers: The Mask</i></p>
<p>Didaskalia, an electronic journal and resource dedicated to the study of ancient Greek and Roman drama in performance<www.didaskalia.net>, is looking for papers and discussions of the mask as it relates to Classics and the theatre, for a thematic issue to appear in 2007.</p>
		 <p>The mask was a defining feature of ancient stage performance, and yet 
how it functioned continues to mystify. We are looking for discussions 
from academics and theatre practitioners to explore how the mask 
creates meaning and changes experience on the stage. All approaches are 
welcome, but we are particularly keen for interdisciplinary discussions 
(from psychology, Asian studies, anthropology, etc.) and for practical 
discussions of the effect of masks on actors and audience: anything 
that can cast light on the mask and its function in antiquity. </p>
<p>As an electronic resource, Didaskalia has no specific limits in terms of 
length, and multimedia submissions are encouraged, which take advantage 
of this electronic format. Electronic submissions and requests for further information should be 
addressed to C. W. Marshall, Classical, Near Eastern, and Religious 
Studies, University of British Columbia [toph AT interchange.ubc.ca]
ideally before December 1, 2006. All submissions will be peer reviewed.

 <i>Didaskalia </i>is one of a number of partners in a large project funded by the UK's Joint Information Systems Committee.

We hope that this will provide an invaluable resource for students, teachers and researchers of ancient drama.
