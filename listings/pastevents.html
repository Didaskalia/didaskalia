		<em>2009 CAMP Staged Reading</em> in Philadelpia, US</em></p>
		<p>The APA's Committee on Ancient and Modern Performance (CAMP) invites proposals for the Eighth Annual Staged Reading, to be performed at the APA/AIA meetings in Philadelphia in January 2009.</p>
<p>
CAMP has sponsored the annual staged reading at the APA/AIA meetings since 2002. The production has become a central event at each year's conference. It brings together APA and AIA members across our various sub-disciplines for a good time apart from the stresses of the rest of the conference. It also sets on display the many talents that usually lie hidden in our profession. And, perhaps most importantly, it demonstrates the centrality of performance in our scholarly understanding of the ancient world and shows that everyone can bring performance back home to their own campuses. At the upcoming 2008 meeting in Chicago, we are proud to present Euripides' satyr play Cyclops, directed by Laura Lippman and Mike Lippman.</p> 
<p>
Also in Chicago, the Committee members hope to move toward selecting a play for the 2009 meeting. We therefore are seeking any ideas that you, fellow Thespians, may have. We are open to proposals for ancient plays and for more recent plays with classical themes. If you have an idea for a play, would you be able and willing to sign on as a director, or do you know someone whom we should ask? The director is given free rein with regard to the artistic realm of the play (albeit on a very limited budget!&#151;the APA generally finances only the printing of a program). The director is responsible, along with a producer if one is appointed, for writing and distributing a call for actors, for casting the show, for planning the production's needs and rehearsal schedule, for maintaining contact with a CAMP liaison and the APA regarding performance progress and needs, and of course for directing the show in Philadelphia. If, however, you are not ready to take the director's seat, but have a good idea for a play that should be produced, please let us know that too. We may be able to find a director suitable to the play.
</p>
<p>
If you would like to submit a proposal, respond to the CAMP subcommittee on the staged reading: myself (givenj AT ecu.edu), John Starks (jhstarksjr AT yahoo.com) and Liz Scharffenberger (hypsipyle AT earthlink.net). </p><br>

	<p><strong>15th November 2007</strong><br>
<em>Classics and Comics</em> 	 *Call for Papers*</p>
	<p>
Proposals are invited for an edited volume to be entitled Classics and Comics, Edited by George Kovacs (University of Toronto) and C. W. Marshall (University of British Columbia). Comics have been a major element of popular culture in North America, Europe, and Japan for over a century. For the past two decades comics have been regarded increasingly as a legitimate artistic and literary medium, through the emergence of the 'graphic novel' (developed literary narratives extending beyond the 22-page single-issue format) and through efforts of scholar/ practitioners such as Will Eisner and Scott McCloud to define the relationship of the comic book to audience, artist, and other artistic media. So far there has been very little work integrating the medium into a larger understanding of Western artistic and literary culture. In Classics and Comics, we shall begin this work by presenting the first extended integration of comics with the foundations of western culture, in a collection of 12-18 chapters, each approximately 5000 words in length.</p>
	<p>
This collection will be aimed at both academic readers and an educated general audience. We seek essays that are both scholarly and engaging, and authors who are equally comfortable in Greek, Latin, and the pre-Crisis history of the Justice League. Given the nature of our subject material, images are essential and contributors will be allowed the equivalent of three or four plates. A major university press has expressed interest in the volume, dependant upon the final submissions.</p>
	<p>
Please send a 400 word abstract, along with a separate file containing your name, the abstract title, and a brief biographical statement (or CV), as email attachments in Word or Rich Text Format to both of the editors:
George Kovacs (george.kovacs AT utoronto.ca) and C.W. Marshall (toph AT interchange.ubc.ca).
Further questions may also be addressed to either of the editors. The deadline for abstract submission is <strong>15th November 2007</strong>. Selected contributors will have until May 2008 for final submission.</p>
<p><strong>12th November 2007</strong><br>
<em>Tara Arts and the Greeks</em> at the Lecture Theatre, Classics Centre, UK</p>
	<p>Jatinder Verma (Artistic Director, Tara Arts Theatre Company) will be giving a lecture at this APGRD event at 2.15pm on Monday 12th November 2007 in the Lecture Theatre, Classics Centre, 66 St Giles. For more information please contact apgrd AT classics.ox.ac.uk.</p>

	<p><strong>13th October 2007</strong><br>
<em>Historiography</em> at Burwalls Centre for Continuing Education, Bristol, UK</p> 
	<p> One of a series of AHRC funded research workshops on <em>THUCYDIDES: Reception, Reinterpretation & Influence</em> taking place at Bristol, Cambridge & Oxford. The work of Thucydides has had a far-reaching influence on the understanding of the modern world; he has been seen as the founder of critical history, as a pioneer in the critique of democracy and as a key thinker in the field of international relations. Remarkably, however, the history of the reception of Thucydides has never been studied in depth. The aim of these workshops is to bring together scholars from different disciplinary traditions to discuss how Thucydides has been read, studied and reinterpreted since the eighteenth century.

	<p><strong>12th July 2007</strong><br>
<em>Ancient Drama in Modern Opera, 1600-1800</em> at APGRD Conference, Classics Centre, Oxford, UK</p>
<p>The importance of Greek drama for the evolution of European opera is well known but tends not to be distinguished from the influence of Greek mythology more generally. In keeping the focus of this conference on the influence of ancient drama in the first 200 years of opera's development we hope to shed new light both on that development and on the reception of Greek drama. The speakers are drawn from the worlds of Classics, Modern Languages, and Music, and they include people involved in the performance of operatic works as well as some of the leading academics in this field. The provisional speakers and paper titles for this conference are as follows:</p>
<p>

<strong>Mr Bruno Forment</strong> (composer and performer; PhD student at University of Ghent), 'The gods out of the machine ... and their come-back'<br>

<p>
After the papers there will be a wine reception and then a short recital of arias from eighteenth-century tragic operas by <em>Ensemble La Falsirena</em> (Suzana Ograjenšek, soprano; Luke Green, harpsichord; Henrik Persson, baroque cello). We currently expect the papers to run from 9.30 to 6.15, and the recital to be over by 8.00.</p>
