</p>
		 <p><em>Oedipus Tyrannus</em> is a dramatic rendering of the story of the downfall of the King of Thebes. Over the course of the play, Oedipus discovers that he has, unwittingly or not, broken two of the most fundamental taboos of human society; patricide and incest. The drama tackles some of the most difficult and disturbing aspects of human desire, violence, and political power. It also highlights the troubled relationship between man and god(s); Apollo is frequently invoked in this play, both as the god of plague and prophesy, and as the god responsible for Oedipus' fall from grace.</p>
   <p><strong><em>Hippolytus</em></strong> by
		 Euripides<br>
		 8th - 26th February 2008<br>
		 Blue Elephant Theatre, 59a Bethwin Rd, Camberwell, London, SE5 0XT, UK<br>
		 Box Office: 020 7701 0100<br>
Website: <a href="www.blueelephanttheatre.co.uk ">www.blueelephanttheatre.co.uk</a>
</p>
 <p>Following last year's The Lady of Shalott, director Aaron Paterson returns to the Blue Elephant with another classic, using his signature style to bring to life the rhythm, images and language of the text through rich movement, music and song. </p>
 <p>
Queen Phaedra lies sick with incestuous love for her stepson Hippolytus. Told of her passion by her faithful nurse, Hippolytus rejects her. Pride, shame, lust, revenge, honour and love interweave culminating in a progressively sharp web of lies and unspoken truths that result only in death and tragedy. </p><br>

 <p><strong><em>Cloudcuckooland, eco warriors and bird poo</em> ... Aristophanes' <em>Birds for kids</em></strong><br>

<p>
The Onassis Programme is proud to have commissioned <em>Cloudcuckooland</em>, a new musical for ages 7+ based on Aristophanes' Birds, with book and lyrics by Stephen Sharkey and music by Alex Silverman. The show will open in Oxford for six performances from 13th February, then tour to Hammersmith, Belfast, Newcastle, Bridgwater, Newport, Sheffield, Brighton, Armagh, Sutton and Greenwich. It is performed by seven actor musicians (who play more instruments between them than you would think possible). This modern adaptation contains lots of slapstick, clowning, juggling, ludicrous big bird costumes and a healthy dollop of political satire. Tour dates:<br><br>

Royal National Theatre, London, UK<br>

<p>
<em>Fram</em> is a major new work by Tony Harrison, whose many plays include <em>The Oresteia</em>, <em>The Trackers of Oxyrhynchus</em> and <em>Hecuba</em>. The epic sweep of this play takes us from a contemporary Westminster Abbey to the Arctic ship Fram &ndash; or Forward &ndash; specially built by the famous Norwegian explorer Fridtjof Nansen who with his suicidal companion Johansen makes a bid on foot for the North Pole in the 1890s. Though incompatible, they share a bear fur sleeping-bag through the long winter. Nansen, still haunted by Johansen's ghost, is appointed to the League of Nations. As a figurehead of Russian famine relief in 1922, he conducts the first celebrity campaign, searching for means, however shocking, to make people care.</p><br>

Zeb Fontaine presents <em>The Cows Come Home</em> &ndash; a chorus for the twenty-first century exploring religious fundamentalism through a farmer and his plagued cattle. </p>
<p>
<em>Cows</em> is bite-sized Dance Theatre, combining in an intimate space the intensive and poetic immediacy of dance and sound.
A farmer experiences a tragic reversal of fortune with his cattle leading to larger questions about suffering, responsibility and God's place in it all. This tragic transposition of the Oedipus story alongside themes of plague and religious belief explore the chorus in the twenty-first century by using dance theatre, sound and movement. It will melt in your mind.</p> 
<p>
During the last few decades UK productions of ancient Greek tragedy have attracted an audience hungry for new theatrical experiences. The modernised reception of tragedy and the chorus has acknowledged the leading influence of Dance Theatre. Increasingly found in fringe theatres such (The Gate, Soho Theatre, Camden People's Theatre), Dance Theatre proposes innovative approaches to the interrelationship of performance space, sound and movement. </p><br>
  <p><strong><em>Out of Chaos -
Physical Theatre Comedy Blending Ancient Greek Mythology & Modern True Stories
</em></strong><br>
		 20th - 24th May 2008<br>
		 Blue Elephant Theatre, 59a Bethwin Rd, Camberwell, London, SE5 0XT, UK<br>
		 Box Office: 020 7701 0100<br>

</p>
<p>
<em>Out of Chaos</em> re-imagines the tragic chorus and incorporates live music, clowning and physical theatre in a devised piece that draws on the international origins of the actors. In the beginning, there was chaos. Then the Gods took that chaos and gave it an order. They made the world and some animals and everything went pretty well. But one day Prometheus made a new beast, and he raised it up onto two feet so it could look at the heavens. Gods and mortals, parents and sons, sisters, lovers and strangers on the Tube come head-to-head in a playful blend of Ancient Greek mythology and modern true stories, exploring the ways in which people fight and rage. In addition to <em>Out of Chaos</em>, Temple Theatre will present a series of short theatre, music, poetry and art events, performed by associate companies and artists, in and around the bar area after the show.</p><br>

		  The Mesopotamian Opera Company presents <em>Thyestes' Feast</em>. A tragedy about two brothers, who vie to rule in the city-state of Mycenae. The elder, Atreus, was king before his wife Aerope betrayed him, taking the younger brother Thyestes as her lover, helping him to steal the golden ram. This golden ram has magical powers. If you possess it you are the king. Thyestes is a liberal, generous ruler and Aerope sees herself as a divinely inspired liberator of her people, not as a wanton adulteress.</p>
