<p><strong><em>Helen</em></strong>
 by Euripides<br>
23rd - 30th September, 2007<br>
University of Utah, Salt Lake City, USA<br>
Directed by Barbara Smith<br>
Website: <a href="http://www.theatre.utah.edu/calendar_current/calendar.htm">www.theatre.utah.edu/calendar_current/calendar.htm</a></p>
<p>In Euripides' surprising take on the tale, Helen was never in Troy, having been spirited away from Sparta and a fake Helen left in her place to be kidnapped and taken to Troy, thus touching off the 10-year war. Continuing Euripides' Trojan War plays, this year we uncover the fate of the real Helen, as she waits in Egypt for news of her husband and fends off a marriage to the new king. This production will tour to Weber State University, Westminster College, and Brigham Young University in September and October.</p>
