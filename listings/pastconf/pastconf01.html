<em>Ancient Drama in Modern Opera, 1600-1800</em> at APGRD Conference, Classics Centre, University of Oxford, UK</p>
 <p>The importance of Greek drama for the evolution of European opera is well known but tends not to be distinguished from the influence of Greek mythology more generally. In keeping the focus of this conference on the influence of ancient drama in the first 200 years of opera's development we hope to shed new light both on that development and on the reception of Greek drama. The speakers are drawn from the worlds of Classics, Modern Languages, and Music, and they include people involved in the performance of operatic works as well as some of the leading academics in this field. The provisional speakers and paper titles for this conference are as follows:</p>
<p>
<strong>Dr. Michael Burden</strong> (Director of Productions, New Chamber Opera), 'Myth in Metastasio's works'<br>
<strong>Mr Bruno Forment</strong> (composer and performer; PhD student at University of Ghent), 'The gods out of the machine ... and their come-back'<br>
<strong>Prof. Wendy Heller</strong> (Department of Music, Princeton University), 'Playing with fortune: the fate of Pyrrhus in seicento Venice'<br>
<strong>Prof. Robert Ketterer</strong> (Department of Classics, University of Iowa), 'The influence of Agostino Piovene's translations of Greek tragedy on his opera libretti in the first quarter of the 18th century'<br>
<strong>Dr. Suzana Ograjenšek</strong> (Research Fellow, Clare Hall, Cambridge), 'Andromache in late 17th and early 18th century operas'<br>
<strong>Prof. Ellen Rosand</strong> (Department of Music, Yale University), 'Classical themes in Monteverdi'<br>
<strong>Prof. Reinhard Strohm</strong> (Faculty of Music, Oxford University), ' "Addio Tebani!" Oedipus Tyrannus as opera seria (1729)'<br>
<strong>Ms Jennifer Thorp</strong> (Archivist, New College, Oxford), 'Dance in Lully's Alceste'<br>
<strong>Dr. Amy Wygant</strong> (School of Modern Languages and Cultures, Glasgow University), 'The Ghost of Alcestis'</p>
<p>
After the papers there will be a wine reception and then a short recital of arias from eighteenth-century tragic operas by <em>Ensemble La Falsirena</em> (Suzana Ograjenšek, soprano; Luke Green, harpsichord; Henrik Persson, baroque cello). We currently expect the papers to run from 9.30 to 6.15, and the recital to be over by 8.00.</p>
<p>

		<em>The Body and the Mask in Ancient Theatre Space: Perceptions, Coincidences and Diversions</em><br> at Handa N&#244; Studio, Royal Holloway University and King's College London, UK</p>
		<p>		
		This symposium is being organised by the AHRC-funded project "The Body and Mask in Ancient Theatre Space", a research collaboration between King's Visualisation Lab at the Centre for Computing in the Humanities, King's College London and the Department of Classics and Ancient History, Durham University. The project concerns ancient masked performance - specifically in terms of spatial environments, intercultural performance and perceptual experience. Using leading-edge 3D technologies it addresses fundamental questions concerning the conditions and actualities of the ancient theatre. What can be inferred of the actor's technique and use of mask and body? How does their semiosis relate to other performance traditions and to constants of human perception? How were these phenomena experienced in the various indoor and outdoor performance spaces of Greece and Rome? How can one productively integrate the study of practice and of the surviving iconography in this research process, and how can 3D technologies be brought to bear at their interface? How does perception of masks compare with that of living human faces, and how far can methodologies concerning visual perception inform an understanding of the ancient mask? How is perception of body and physical movement related to how the mask is 'read'?</p>
		<p>	
 The work of the project includes the creation of full-sized masks for performance based upon terracotta miniature artefacts, complemented by other sources of material evidence, and the use of 3D motion-capture to record movements of performers and placing performers in virtually-realised ancient theatre spaces. In addition the research team is collaborating with artists from Asian mask theatre traditions whose insights into the use of masks we hope will illuminate performative aspects of lost Western traditions. The first collaboration has been with the renowned Japanese N&#244; performer, Matsui Akira who will attend and present a workshop/performance at the conference.</p>
		<p>
 The conference will provide an opportunity for members of the team to present some of the underlying research questions as well as initial results and insights. The project is headed by Professor Richard Beacham, Director of King's Visualisation Lab at the Centre for Computing in the Humanities. Members of the research team include Dr. Hugh Denard (KCL), Dr. Richard Williams (Durham), Dr. Margaret Coldiron (Durham) and Martin Blazeby, Drew Baker and Michael Takeo Magruder of KCL.</p>
		<p><strong>
CALL FOR PAPERS and PRESENTATIONS:</strong> Presentations are invited from scholars and practitioners in fields related to the work of the project including (but not limited to) Classics, Art History, Theatre and Performance Studies, Digital Art and Media, Psychology and Perception Studies, Dance, Mask making and Scenography.</p>

 <em>Pronomos: his vase and its world, APGRD Conference</em> at Magdalen College, University of Oxford, UK</p>
  <p>
  This conference brings together international experts on the cultural context of Athenian theatre and its relationship to vase-painting. Discussion will be centred around the Pronomos Vase, probably the most important artefact for the visual, social and cultic representation of Greek drama within antiquity. Although this vase has been known since the nineteenth century, and is widely referred to and reproduced, there has been an extraordinary lack of a coordinated discussion of its many aspects. The conference grows out of a sense that the time is ripe for a combination of approaches &ndash; theatre history, art history, music, politics, victory celebration &ndash; to bring to light unnoticed and neglected aspects of the vase and its world.
