  <p><i><u>Birds </u></i><u>by Aristophanes</u><br>
 14 - 29 September 2002<br>
 Reed College Campus, Portland, Oregon: 600-seat Cerf outdoor amphitheatre<br>
 Wed, Thur, Fri schools at 12 noon. Saturday and Sundays at 4pm<br>
 Produced by Classic Greek Theatre of Oregon<br>
 Directed and English version by Keith Scales<br>
 Original Music by Mark LaPierre / Choreography by Sandy Shaner<br>
 The play is dressed in ancient Greek and fantasy bird costumes. The time of the action is understood to be Greek mythtime. Paradoxically, the Athens the protagonists are running away from becomes, for us, a metaphor, and thus a &quot;traditional&quot; version of the play is actually a radical treatment.We find we do not need to emphasise the parallels with modern corporate America too heavily. This is not a college production. All artists involved are full-time working professionals. This will be the tenth year CGTO has offered a classically dressd production with full singing, dancing chorus outdoors by daylight.<br>
 Regular: $15 / Students/Seniors $10<br>
