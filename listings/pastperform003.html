  <p><i><u>Orestes 2.5</u></i><u> by Beyond the Proscenium Productions</u><br>
 19 April - 12 May 2002. Friday and Saturday nights at 8pm. Matinee performances: 28 April &amp; 12 May 2002 at 2pm.<br>
 California Stage, 25th &amp; R Streets in Midtown Sacramento. <br>
 A multi-media adaptation of the classic Greek tragic-comedy in the modern world of terrorism and media influences.This retelling of the classic Greek tragic-comedy of Orestes, in which Orestes is commanded to kill his mother as retribution for his mother's actions in the murder of his father, is part of playwright Charles Mee's (re)working project. In the Charles Mee version, <i>Orestes 2.0</i>, Mee has collaged other modern texts into the play. This results in a theatrical piece that takes the action and characters and places them in a modern idiom while being true to their mythic roots. In the words of the great 20th Century artist and collagist Max Ernst, these different text sources bring[s] together disparate images to create a new poetical manifestation.<br>

  <p><u><i>The Phoenician Women</i> by Euripides</u><br>
 20 - 23 March 2002. Patrick Centre (at the Hippodrome), Thorp Street, Birmingham, UK<br>
 Translated by David Thompson. Directed by Steven Little. A Birmingham School of Speech and Drama production.<br>
 Euripides here rewrites the stories told by Sophocles (in <i>Oedipus Rex</i> and <i>Antigone</i>) and Aeschylus (in <i>Seven Against Thebes</i>). Written in 409BC, at a time when the Athenians were in the midst of the Peloponnesian War and losing badly, Euripides' play can be seen as a warning of the devastation that war can create and as such it is as relevant today as it ever was.<br>

  <p><i><u>The Game of Destiny </u></i><u>by The Warwickshire County Music Theatre Company</u><i><br>

 15 April 2002. 7.30pm, Bridge House Theatre, Warwick School, UK (Tel: 01926 412803)<br>
 The story begins just as the Trojan War ends. Aeneas, his family and his followers only escape from the destruction of Troy by the skin of their teeth. It doesn't make it any easier for them that the gods seem to be playing a game with their human suffering: Aeneas is a sort of football between Juno and his mother, Venus. Crete, North Africa, Italy: Giants, Monsters, Hurricanes, Ghosts. You name it, it happens to the Trojans as they try to fulfil Aeneas' destiny and reach a new city called Rome. But in the meantime, something is disrupting the gods' fun and games. Could it be human free will? You may have come across Virgil's story of Aeneas before. But not like this you haven't!<br>
