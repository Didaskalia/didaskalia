		 <p><strong><em>The Bacchae of Bagdad</em> </strong></em>by Conall Morrison<br>
 From 4th March 2006, Abbey Theatre, Dublin, Ireland <br>
		 A new version of Euripides&rsquo; <strong><em>The Bacchae</em></strong><br>
		 Box Office + 353 ( 01) 87 87 222</p>
 <p>Press Release: &quot;When the charismatic eastern god Dionysus arrives with the Bacchae, his horde of female disciples, he is viewed by the autocratic king, Pentheus, as a dangerous &lsquo;other&rsquo; &ndash; an unknown and barbaric threat. The clash that ensues between these two potentates pits scepticism against piety, order against chaos, austerity against excess. Relishing both the moral complexity and theatricality of the piece, Morrison mounts a whirlwind production that spins debate, dance, song and spectacle.&quot;</p><br>

The Onassis Programme presents the UK Premiere of <em>Swallow Song</em>. Drawing on Greek tragedy, lyric poetry, folk songs and music, Swallow Song explores growing up and coming of age in Ancient Greece: the innocence and harsh experiences of a childhood spent amidst the wars and struggles of adults. Highlights include translated verses from Ion, Trojan Women and Iphigenia in Aulis by Euripides, poetry by Sappho and Oedipus by Sophocles.</p>
<p><em>Swallow Song</em> is adapted, directed by, and stars Lyrida Koniordou, long considered to be the finest classical Greek actress of her generation. 
Costume and set design are by the internationally renowned Dionysis Fotopoulos, with translation by Oliver Taplin. A stunning original score by Takis Farazis completes an evening of music, theatre and dance. Six Greek principals and three musicians are joined on stage by a chorus of emerging young English actors.</p>
