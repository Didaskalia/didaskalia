   Directed by Robert  Gillespie<br>
Londinium, 2 AD, three Roman women determined to survive... Inspired by ancient 
  recipes and archaeological remains in Southwark, ace Eastenders scriptwriter 
  Deborah Cook has concocted two intriguing tales of Roman women far from 
  home.<br>
A Baked Swan: 
  Flavia is preparing yet another dinner party for her husband and his 
  associates, where exotic ingredients peppered with spicy Roman gossip 
  combine to leave a pungent aftertaste.</p>
The Main Event: 
  Superstar gladiatrix Claudia is about to top the bill against her former 
  slave, Greeneyes, in front of a thousand eager spectators. As they prepare 
  for combat they reveal the astonishing events that transformed them 
  from mistress and slave to equals in the arena of life and death.
  The two plays form a moving exploration of subtle class attitudes and 
  bitter gallows humour in a society where women were the disposable property 
  of men.<br>
