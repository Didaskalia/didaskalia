<em>The Body and the Mask in Ancient Theatre Space: The State of the Art</em> at King's College London, Strand, UK</p>
  <p>

This 2-day interdisciplinary conference organised by the AHRC-funded project "The Body and Mask in Ancient Theatre Space" is a research collaboration between King's Visualisation Lab at the Centre for Computing in the Humanities, King's College London and the Department of Classics and Ancient History, Durham University. The project concerns ancient masked performance - specifically in terms of spatial environments, intercultural performance and perceptual experience. Using leading-edge 3D technologies it addresses fundamental questions concerning the conditions and actualities of the ancient theatre.

  <p><strong>15th - 16th May 2008</strong><br>
<em>What is Masculinity? How useful is it as a Historical Category?</em> at Birkbeck College, University of London, UK</p>
  <p>
		In recent years, there has been an explosion in scholarship that questions masculinity in history. This vibrant new approach has incorporated many different theoretical and empirical considerations in historical scholarship. Birkbeck College, University of London, is hosting a conference on 15th and 16th May 2008, with the idea of providing a discussion across fields and time period specialism. We would welcome papers in contemporary and modern, early modern, medieval, Classical and non-western history, from historians throughout the world who are working in the general field of masculinity studies. We hope the conference will provide discussion of the latest thinking, debates and contention in this field, and that it will serve as a review of 'where we are now' in terms of scholarship in the field of masculinity studies.</p>
		<p>
The highest quality papers in this conference will be published in a single volume collection, by Palgrave Macmillan. Please send your proposal to Dr Sean Brady, Birkbeck College University of London, by attachment to s.brady AT bbk.ac.uk.</p>
