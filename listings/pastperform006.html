  Suessical spin on the classic Greek comedy <i>Lysistrata</i> by Aristophanes.  Tensions mount as the women bar the gates, and leave the men to decide  for themselves where their priorities lie. Come and see the playing  of a tale so tall it can hardly be believed. <br>

 <p><u><i>Hecuba </i>by  Euripides - A Reading</u><br>
  26 May 2003, Memorial Day. 7.30pm, The Sixth @ Penn Theatre, 3704 6th  Avenue in Hillcrest, San Diego, California, USA<br>
  In observance of Memorial Day, Grass Roots Greeks, the San Diego theater  troupe dedicated to ancient Greek tragedy, will be reading <i>Hecuba</i>.  Part of its regular series of readings on the last Monday of every month  at 6th @ Penn theatre. Euripides' play is an early treatment of the  subject to which the playwright would return some nine years later in  his classic <i>The Trojan Women</i>. Set in the aftermath of the fall  of the city of Troy, <i>Hecuba</i> deals with subjects as familiar to  us as today's headlines: how is justice administered in a war-torn capitol?  What is the balance between justice and politics in the post-war struggles  that consume both the vanquished and the victors? In such an environment,  how does one honor the dead of both sides? In the U. S., Memorial Day  is about honoring all the American soldiers killed in the country's  wars from the beginning of our history. We felt that Euripides' lesser  known play about the fall of Troy would be a fitting way for us to contribute  to the day's events, to enable all of us to think and feel deeply about  both our past wars and our current ones, as they affect both our own  soldiers and the people of rest of the world.<br>

 <p><u><i>Orestes 2.0 </i>by Charles L. Mee</u><br>
  13 - 27 April 2003 (Previews 13 and 15 April, 2003). <font color="#000000">Penthouse Theater, University of Washington Campus<br>
 UW School of Drama. Director: Rebecca Brown.<br>
  Ancient Greek mythology juxtaposed with contemporary culture brings  Euripides' tragedy right to our doorstep. Borrowing text from an eclectic  variety of 20th-century sources, from Soap Opera digest to William S.  Burroughs, popular historian, award-winning playwright Charles Mee's  theatrical montage is a fresh and disturbing look at the desperate hope  that a god will descend to erase our present horror. <br>
  Tickets $8 / $12, Students $7. Previews $5. Box Office: UW Arts Ticket  Office, 4001 University Way NE. Tel. (206) 543-4880<br>
