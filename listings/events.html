   <p><strong>26th October 2009</strong><br>
The screening of <em>Iphigenia in Aulis</em> at the Ionnnou Centre, Oxford, UK</strong></p>

 <p><strong>11th September 2009</strong><br>
The screening of <em>Iphigenia in Aulis</em> at the Dramatiska institutet, Valhallav&#0228;gen 189, Stockholm, Sweden</p>
 <p>The concept of a unified subject which found its most congenial expression in realistic dramaturgy and charactercentred
theatre is nowadays problematic. The dethronement and crackling of character, the individual as conglomerate of sub-individuals, multi-facetted identities and simulation characterizes the contemporary understanding of the Self. The seminar will investigate some of the links between the ideas which form the representations of the human being in some modern drama/theatre and the concept of the Mask.

 <p><strong>4th September 2009</strong><br>
<em>Mask and Space</em> at the Dramatiska institutet, Valhallav&#0228;gen 189, Stockholm, Sweden</strong></p>
 <p>The mask influences the experience and consciousness of the spatial and temporal dimensions of movement and
  stillness. The mask accentuates the consciousness in the performer of the body&rsquo;s presence in space and creates a
  heightened and intense experience of dramatic time and space for both the audience and the performer. The seminar will investigate aspects of the interaction between the concepts of Mask and Space. To register, please email: helena.falck AT draminst.se</p><br>

Stanford Summer Theater: The <em>Electra</em> Festival at Stanford, USA</strong></p>
  <p>Celebrating its 11th season, Stanford Summer Theater (SST) presents 'The <em>Electra</em> Festival', an exploration through theater and film of one of the great mythic heroines. Electra's story&#151;the saga of the house of Atreus, the Trojan War, and its aftermath&#151;has inspired playwrights, novelists, composers, film directors, and thinkers over the centuries. The <em>Electra</em> Festival allows us to trace the influence of this classic myth from ancient Athens to the contemporary world. </p>
   <p>The <em>Electra</em> Festival features a major production of Sophocles' <em>Electra</em>, using MacArthur-Award winner Anne Carson's masterful translation. Directed by SST Artistic Director Rush Rehm, <em>Electra</em> includes a stellar cast (L. Peter Callender, Kay Kostopoulos, Valentina Cond&#233;, Courtney Walsh, Florentina Mocanu), along with a formidable design team. The <em>Electra</em> Festival also includes staged readings of two earlier versions of the story, Aeschylus' devastating Libation Bearers and Euripides' strangely contemporary Electra. Using translations designed specifically for performance, these performances invite us into the wider world of fifth-century Athens and its fascination with revenge and justice in the aftermath of the Trojan War. </p>
