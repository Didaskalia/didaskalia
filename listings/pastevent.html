  <p><strong>In Search of Dionysus</strong><br>
 20 May 2001, Portland, Oregon, USA<br>
 Keith Scales, artistic director of Classic Greek Theatre of Oregon, was awarded a Civic Theatre Guild Fellowship to develop a new English text of Euripides <i>The Bacchae</i>. The work involved extensive research into the exotic and mysterious cult of Dionysus, which became the predominant form of worship in ancient Greece. Dionysus is the god of ecstatic experience and living nature. His temple is the theatre. This hour-long presentation will include an overview of the practice and development of the Dionysian religion, and excerpts from Scales version of <i>The Bacchae</i>, which will receive its premiere performances in Portland in September 2001. For further information contact Keith Scales 503-257-8972, or Dan Eikler (Borders Books) 503-221-9814, or Classic Greek Theatre of Oregon 503-258-9313. Admission Free</p>
