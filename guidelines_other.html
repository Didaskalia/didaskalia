<h1 class="page_title">Guidelines for Other Submissions</h1>
<p>In addition to <strong>Articles</strong> and <strong>Reviews</strong>, <em>Didaskalia </em>welcomes  a wide variety of pieces in its Views section.   Since such pieces are new developments for the journal, these guidelines  are preliminary and will evolve.</p>
<h2>Previews</h2>
<p>
  We welcome pieces  about upcoming productions, especially those giving a sense of the aesthetic  and critical questions at stake in preparation.   We expect a preview to be more than a simple advertisement for the event  (for that, please submit a listing to the <em>Dionysiac</em>):  it should take advantage of the opportunity to engage with the community of  fellow scholars and practitioners of ancient performance.</p>
<h2>Interviews</h2>
<p>
  We seek text,  audio, or video interviews of artists and/or scholars involved in ancient  performance.  We particularly want to  make full use of our online capabilities.   Any serious discussion of large or small questions of ancient  performance could make for a compelling conversation. </p>
<h2>Views</h2>
<p>
  Opinion or  personal pieces or non-article essays on aspects of ancient performance have a  place in <em>Didaskalia</em>.  We need a sense of the work being done, even  if no analytical or critical arguments have emerged immediately from the  work.  We also value the personal  responses of scholars and practitioners to ideas, events, and people in the  field.</p>
<h2>On View</h2>
<p>
  Please send  notices of upcoming events to Hallie Marshall (<strong>halliem@interchange.ubc.ca</strong>).</p>
<p>Items for the  Views sections can be less formal than articles but will still be edited to  meet our standards of quality.</p>
<p>If you have  doubts about where in <em>Didaskalia</em> your  submission belongs or questions about how to shape a potential submission,  please consult with the editors.</p>
<p>Please see the <a href="guidelines_general.html"><strong>General Guidelines</strong></a> for basic issues of  style and format.</p>
