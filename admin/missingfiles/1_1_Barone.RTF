It is the dry soil of the Greekcountryside, animated by a single olive tree which stands outagainst the background of a clear sky which changes its brightnessand intensity in conjunction with the passage of dramatic time. Allthe elements of rural daily life are present: the plow, the amphorafor water, the tools of farming. In the distance are the voices of thecountryside: the barking of dogs, the song of a cat, the chirping ofcicadas.The first to appear is Electra, dressed with rustic poverty, bentunder the weight of a basket on her back. The eruption whichemerges from her lips, a mixture of prayer and complaintproportionate to her terrible suffering, is monotonous, withoutdramatic force, alien to all pathos. Electra attends, methodical andindefatigable, to her thankless task: she collects stones from amongthe furrows of farmland and casts them into her basket, which sheempties at the edge of the field from time to time.In Massimo Castri's dramaturgical adaptation, the arrival ofOrestes, in the petit-bourgeois dress of the beginning of thecentury, with two cumbersome sacks in his hands, comes late anddeprived of the comforting presence of Pylades: a slenderizing ofthe text, which also sees the elimination of the character of thefarmer, Electra's chaste husband, and of almost the entirety of thechorus' role. There are considerable cuts in the text (destined toarouse perplexity in many philologists), dictated by the obstinatequest for that exact naturalism which characterizes the great part ofthe direction and which finds a valid support in the spare, incisiveprose translation of Umberto Albini and Vico Faggi.In order not to make this thinning out a prejudicial factor, one mustrecognize that the text in its essence is not embarrassed by it. Thefigure of Electra, even more isolated, emerges with all her tragicforce. The excellent interpretation of Galatea Ranzi presents uswith a realistic, psychologically based character, but dry, free frommelodramatic attitudes. It is an interpretive style which reaches itssober, almost frozen, culmination in the recognition scene and inthe monologue over the body of Aegisthus, when the explosion oflong repressed passion will take the form of a mad dance, hesitant,streaked with hysteria, on the brink of violent explosion yetnevertheless without that screeching emphasis which is too oftenjoined to Greek tragedy.Of high quality also is the interpretation of Annamaria Guarnier, aClytemnestra covered with lace, with a flowered hat, a parasol,and a train. She is chasing a dream of motherhood destroyed firstthrough the cruel determination of her husband, who immolatedIphigeneia, then through that of her cowardly lover, who hasalienated her from her children. The only time she seems cognizantof Electra's miserable condition and seeks to establish a long-overdue dialogue with her is through physical contact, arrangingher tangled hair.Orestes, the instrument the revenge according to the plandeveloped by his sister, is hesitant, Electra's puppet, which shedominates and commands. The young man prepares to completethe crime with great reluctance and in the final act, the matricide,cannot bear up emotionally.What little remains of the chorus' part is entrusted to two twinsisters, playful, ironic, in a stylized dialectic contrasting with theprecise realism of the main characters. The two girls also undertakethe part of the messenger, played with vivacity and articulated as akind of dialogue in two voices, that of Orestes and that ofAegisthus. They also play the <I>deus ex machina</I>, represented inthe form of two angels, falsely and pompously solemn, indifferentto the fates of men.Cast:Electra: Galatea RanziOrestes: Fabrizio GifuniClytemnestra: Annamaria GuarnieriOld Man: Antonio PierfedericiChorus, Dioscuri: Marisa and Paola Della Pasqua Set Design:Maurizio BaloCostumes: Claudia CalvaresiFor further information contact:Dott.
