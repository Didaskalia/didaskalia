This is the department's third production of a comedy of
Aristophanes. In many ways, it resembles its predecessors in that
the format is recognisably Greek but enlivened by wilful
anachronism. The production is light in tone until the interval,
which follows the induction of Pheidippides into the <I>Thinkery</I>.
After this the mood becomes darker, and the <I>peripeteia</I> hinted at
earlier by the clouds will be uncompromisingly portrayed. The
crass violence in this part of the play will probably not have the
same effect on our audience as on Aristophanes'; the director
awaits the outcome with interest.
